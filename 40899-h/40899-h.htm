<h2>The Morning Glory Club</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Wheels Begin to Move</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ezra</span>, this is a morning long to be remembered,"
said Mrs. Tweedie, as she looked up from
the undulating top of a huge cake which, with the
skill of a professional plasterer, she was bedaubing
with a dark brown paste.</p>

<p>"I hope so, my dear," her husband replied,
smilingly, as he put his paper aside.</p>

<p>"Sometime this house may bear a tablet of
bronze," continued Mrs. Tweedie, "on which,
in effect, will be graven that here was founded
by the women of Manville an organization that
startled the community."</p>

<p>"My only regret is that I shall not be here to
see it&mdash;I mean the tablet, of course," said Ezra.</p>

<p>"We shall prove," Mrs. Tweedie went on with
her eyes fixed dreamily on a distant corner of the
kitchen, "we shall prove that the accusation
which you made in anger one week ago to-night,
that 'women are the cause of all of the trouble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the world,' is false! False as the affection of
men!"</p>

<p>Ezra's smile faded to a look that suggested a
complication of homesickness and <i>mal de mer</i>.
The incident to which Mrs. Tweedie referred was
not their first quarrel. The first had taken place
years before, and ever since Ezra had been different.</p>

<p>"My dear," he replied, weakly, attempting not
to let his feelings show in his voice, "you always
accomplish whatever you attempt."</p>

<p>"And why, Ezra, why do I succeed?" (Mrs.
Tweedie was given to boasting when alone with
her little, ladylike husband.) "Because," she
continued, replying to her own question, "I possess
and use that rare virtue called tact."</p>

<p>"True, my dear, very true," Ezra acknowledged,
meekly. "I have known always that you had
enough for two." He might have added truthfully
that, had it not been for her remarkable tact, and
the fact that one of her relatives had indiscreetly
died intestate during their courtship, he would not
have married her.</p>

<p>The income which "dear cousin John's" carelessness
and the statutes gave them was small; only
Mrs. Tweedie's tact made it possible for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
family of four to exist in the sham style which they
affected. Despite her tact, their credit was constantly
stretched and perilously near to the C.O.D.
point; in fact, the feelings of all the tradesmen of
Manville were correctly described when the milkman
vowed that the Tweedies would be supplied
from the bottom of the can until they had settled for
the top. Considered from every point of view the
Tweedies were strange people.</p>

<p>The idea of a club for women was not new to
the world, but to the New England town of Manville
it was as new as the newest baby. The germ
had taken up its abode in Mrs. Tweedie's head a
week before, and since its arrival had buzzed so
furiously that she was conscious of nothing else.</p>

<p>Two hours after her conversation with Ezra,
Mrs. Tweedie was ready to meet the ladies whom
she had invited to take part in the materialization
of her idea. When the door-bell rang announcing
the first arrival, she hastened to the parlour and
assumed a becoming attitude, while Ezra, who
impersonated Dora, their maid, when she was
otherwise occupied, went to the door.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Flint, my dear," Ezra announced a moment
later, as he bowed the lady named into the
parlour, and then vanished. Mrs. Tweedie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
very fond of Mrs. Flint, her beloved pastor's wife,
and greeted her with as much cordiality as it was
possible for her to display. The chief reason for
her fondness was the fact that Mrs. Flint belonged
to one of the oldest families in the State. Her
blood was as blue as the bluest blue, and her ancestry
could be traced back into a delightful abyss
of years. Mrs. Tweedie had a profound respect
for such things&mdash;she had ancestors herself.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Mrs. Flint, after they had
chatted about little nothings for five minutes,
"how have you succeeded? Was your club idea
well received?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed," replied Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"And did many promise to come?"</p>

<p>"Every one on whom I called was delighted,
and promised to be here this morning," said Mrs.
Tweedie, proudly.</p>

<p>"Very encouraging, I'm sure," murmured Mrs.
Flint, as she glanced about the room and noticed
that there was dust on the family Bible. Mrs.
Tweedie knew it was there. She also knew that
Mrs. Flint knew, and was annoyed.</p>

<p>"I have heard that your son William has returned,"
observed Mrs. Tweedie, hoping to divert
Mrs. Flint's mind from the dusty Bible to a subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that could not be wholly agreeable to the
minister's wife, if the rumours which had reached
Mrs. Tweedie were founded on fact.</p>

<p>"Yes, college life is <i>so</i> trying for a young man
at William's critical age. He seems to have broken
down completely," sadly replied the fond mamma
of one hundred and eighty pounds of beef, bone,
and deviltry.</p>

<p>"Indeed! I am very sorry to hear of his condition,
but rejoiced to know that I have been incorrectly
informed concerning his reason for
leaving college," said Mrs. Tweedie. "You must
be very happy with him at home again after such
a long absence."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Flint, telling one of those
weak little lies that we all indulge in when it seems
to be really necessary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie's feminine instinct told her the
truth, and she generously dropped William for
something more closely related to the club idea.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have invited Mrs. Stout to join. What
do you think of her?" she asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"She does not attend our church&mdash;of course
that would make no difference, but&mdash;" The
minister's wife hesitated, and raised her eyes significantly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her grammar is shocking&mdash;she speaks so
plainly," said Mrs. Tweedie, her nose in air.
"And her manners and dress are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," prompted Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"The very word."</p>

<p>"She has, probably, admirable qualities, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt, except&mdash;there's the bell!" And
then Mrs. Tweedie added in a whisper, "I would
not have this repeated for worlds."</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Stout entered the room unannounced.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Stout, good morning," said
Mrs. Tweedie. "We were just this moment
speaking of you."</p>

<p>"Was you now?" smilingly responded Mrs.
Stout, as she sat down in the largest chair in the
room and began fanning herself with a photograph
that she took from a table. "How d'y do,
Mis' Flint. I ain't set eyes on you since our Fast
Day union meetin'. How's the parson? I heard
he was feelin' kinder streaked."</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you," replied Mrs. Flint,
rather coldly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout was the wife of Peter Stout, grocer,
and the mother of three boys. Though her grammar,
manners, and dress did not reach to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Tweedie's lofty ideals, she had many friends in
Manville among those who did not pretend to be
more than they were. Her family&mdash;of course
she had a father and mother, but her grandfathers
and grandmothers&mdash;no one had ever taken the
pains to draw the likeness of a tree and write on
its naked branches the names of her ancestors.
Despite the lack of grandfathers and grandmothers,
she had a large measure of common
sense, and a big heart.</p>

<p>"We don't seem to be crowded here," remarked
Mrs. Stout, after a moment's pause. "Anybody
else comin'?"</p>

<p>"We hope so, but it is early yet, you know, only
half-past ten," explained Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Early? Good land!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout.
"I've been up these five hours and done all my
work. Oh, there was somethin' I wanted to ask
perticler. Is Lizzie Sawyer goin' to join?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Tweedie, and wondered
what was coming next.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Stout, confidentially, "the
reason I wanted to know was that she and I don't
get along very well together, but there, I guess we
can manage somehow to keep from clashin'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie saw rough weather ahead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
proceeded to pour oil upon the waters before the
storm broke.</p>

<p>"Miss Sawyer was one of the first asked to
join," she replied. "She is an exceptionally
well-educated woman, and has signified her willingness
to read several papers on vital topics before
the club when we are ready for such work."</p>

<p>"Papers? Newspapers?" Mrs. Stout asked,
with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Papers&mdash;essays on&mdash;on&mdash;"
Mrs. Tweedie tried to reduce her language to
Mrs. Stout's mental level in vain.</p>

<p>"Oh, how stoopid I am!" Mrs. Stout interrupted,
thereby unconsciously rescuing Mrs.
Tweedie from her difficulty, "I understand now.
I s'pose she'll try to tell us a lot about religion,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Mrs. Tweedie, quickly,
"I think not. Would it be wise to discuss religion
at our meetings? I am sure that the <i>other sex</i>
never tolerate it in their organizations."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you mean the men?" queried Mrs.
Stout.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, that's true enough, I guess, but it ain't
because they don't think it's wise. It's because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
men don't naturally hanker after religion. There's
my husband, a good 'nough man, but I can't get
him to go to meetin' to save me, though he will go
fishin' spite of all I can say or do."</p>

<p>"Really!" gasped Mrs. Flint. "Does he
really fish on the Sabbath?"</p>

<p>"He certainly does," replied Mrs. Stout,
"jest as reg'lar as he eats his vi't'ls."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie and Mrs. Flint were horribly
shocked, and to their cultured minds perhaps
"vi't'ls" was quite as shocking as Sabbath fishing.</p>

<p>"And what else are we goin' to do besides
havin' papers read?" continued Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"We hope," replied Mrs. Tweedie, "to spend
our time in the study and discussion of subjects
which will be uplifting, that will make ourselves,
and aid us in helping others, to be stronger, morally
and intellectually."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" said Mrs. Stout, with
mock gravity. "And when we ain't doin' that I
s'pose we'll be talkin' about other folks and their
businesses."</p>

<p>"I trust not," replied Mrs. Tweedie, much distressed.
"Of course, some people are improperly
interested in the affairs of others, but we hope that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
those so inclined will not become members of our
club."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so, too," said Mrs. Stout, with a
suspicious twinkle in her eyes. "But it's hard,
dreadful hard, Mis' Tweedie, to get a crowd of
women folks together without some one sayin'
somethin' about somebody that they wouldn't
have said if she was there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie was as near to tears of mortification
as a woman of her kind ever gets. She had
never realized before how brutally truthful Mrs.
Stout could be.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, abruptly changing
the subject, "is Miss Wallace, the schoolteacher
that boards with you, goin' to belong?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Tweedie. "She is heartily
in sympathy with us, but will not be able to attend
many meetings because of her work."</p>

<p>"I'm real glad that she's goin' to join, I like
her," said Mrs. Stout, simply, and she meant it.
Miss Wallace was likable, but not many in Manville
had discovered her good qualities. "There's
somebody else!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, as she
heard the bell which rang at that moment, and
then added, quickly, "Excuse <i>me</i>, of course you
don't go to the door when you have a girl."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>A soft voice was heard asking for Mrs. Tweedie,
and then the masculine tones of Dora inviting
some one to come in.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you, Miss Sawyer?" said Mrs.
Tweedie, all smiles, when the newcomer appeared
in the doorway. "We are so glad that you could
come. Of course, you know Mrs. Stout, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Sawyer bowed stiffly.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said Mrs. Stout, telling the
lie that has been told oftener than any other.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth Sawyer was a lady of&mdash;her
age does not matter. She was tall and very slight,
her hair was gray, and her eyes were the bulging,
staring kind that always seemed about to jump
from their sockets, caused in some degree, perhaps,
by the black-rimmed eye-glasses secured
by a heavy cord which she constantly wore. She
had the reputation of being very intellectual.
The very person, Mrs. Tweedie thought, to shine
in a woman's club.</p>

<p>When Miss Sawyer spied Mrs. Flint she rushed
into her arms. She considered Mrs. Flint as near
her equal mentally as it was possible for any
woman in Manville to be. They sat down together,
and cooed for several minutes in the most impolite
manner possible, so Mrs. Tweedie thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
probably because she could not hear a word that
they said. Mrs. Stout moved uneasily, and Mrs.
Tweedie coughed several times, but with no
effect.</p>

<p>"Ain't it most time we was doin' somethin'
about this club we came here to get up?" Mrs.
Stout asked, impatiently, when she could contain
herself no longer.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Tweedie, "when the
others are ready; and I was waiting&mdash;I had
hoped that my daughter Fanny, she is to be one
of us, you know, would be here by this time. I
can't imagine&mdash;" Mrs. Tweedie was interrupted
by the entrance of her son Thomas, the
bad angel of the Tweedie household.</p>

<p>"Ma," he blubbered, "Dora won't give me a
piece of cake. Can't I have some, ma?" This
exhibition of domestic turmoil made Mrs. Tweedie
very angry, and it was with difficulty that she
controlled herself.</p>

<p>"Thomas, leave the room immediately," she
commanded, sternly.</p>

<p>"Am I goin' to have any cake?" the young
man demanded when he saw that tears were of
no avail.</p>

<p>"Thomas, I insist upon your leaving the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at once," replied his mother, firmly. The ladies
were watching breathlessly the contest between
mother and son.</p>

<p>"I won't go 'less I can have some cake," said
the boy, defiantly. Mrs. Tweedie went to the
door, and called for Dora. The silence that followed
was so impressive that Thomas would have
succumbed had it lasted a moment longer than
it did. When Dora came Mrs. Tweedie, with
much determination and latent anger, said:</p>

<p>"Dora, assist Thomas from the room." Dora
was delighted; here was an opportunity for revenge.
Her hand went out quickly toward her
prey, but Thomas dodged.</p>

<p>"I won't go!" he screamed.</p>

<p>"Thomas," said Mrs. Tweedie, sadly, "shall
I call your father?" A broad grin spread over
the boy's face, and Dora snickered.</p>

<p>"I ain't 'fraid of him," he said, saucily.</p>

<p>"Take him away instantly, Dora!" Mrs.
Tweedie ordered, angrily. Dora was more successful
in her next attempt to capture Thomas,
though a vase was broken and two chairs were
overturned while she was dragging him from the
room.</p>

<p>"Ladies," said Mrs. Tweedie, in a choking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
voice, as she removed her glasses and wiped them,
"I cannot tell you how grieved I am to have our
meeting interrupted&mdash;" A crash was heard at
that moment, the sound coming from the direction
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I guess somebudy's dropped somethin'," suggested
Mrs. Stout. Her surmise was correct. Dora
had dropped Thomas, and dropped him hard.
Mrs. Tweedie wiped her eyes, put on her glasses,
and wondered how much damage had been done.</p>

<p>"Thomas is a very impulsive child," she said,
"I hope that you will overlook this rare breach
in his customary commendable deportment. And
now, had we not better make a start at least on the
work for which we are gathered?"</p>

<p>"I should say it was time," replied Mrs. Stout.
"Up to now we've talked about everything from
here to Halifax 'cept business."</p>

<p>"The <i>other sex</i>," continued Mrs. Tweedie, after
listening a moment to be sure that her domestic
affairs were running smoothly, or, at least, noiselessly,
"the <i>other sex</i>," she repeated, "have their
lodges and clubs, why should not we band ourselves
together in a similar manner, and become,
in the community, a great power for good?"</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>," interrupted Mrs. Stout, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
don't you think it's terrible hot here? I'm 'most
melted."</p>

<p>Miss Sawyer looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Stout, I am positively chilly," she
said, coughing dismally.</p>

<p>"I will open a window." Mrs. Tweedie spoke
impatiently as she got up and attempted to raise
a window. It resisted her efforts. "Really, I
can't imagine why it will not open&mdash;I'll try the
other." She did so, but again her efforts were
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"I guess it's the damp weather," suggested
Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," replied Mrs. Tweedie, as she
went to the door and called for Dora, and then by
way of explanation turned to the ladies and added,
"Dora is very strong."</p>

<p>"Did you call, ma'am?" asked Dora, a moment
later, as she appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want you to open a window," Mrs.
Tweedie replied, shortly. Dora advanced on one
of the stubborn windows and exerted all her
strength. Conversation ceased, all eyes were
upon Dora. Failing at one window, she attempted
another with the same result. The windows could
not be opened by woman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't do it, ma'm," said Dora, her face very
red.</p>

<p>"Call Mr. Tweedie," Mrs. Tweedie commanded.
"One of those windows shall be opened!"</p>

<p>Dora hurried from the room, and then Mrs.
Stout laughed irritatingly.</p>

<p>"Tell us, pray," said Mrs. Tweedie, haughtily,
"the cause of your mirth."</p>

<p>"You must excuse <i>me</i>, ladies," Mrs. Stout
began, but another burst of laughter that she
could not control prevented her from continuing
for several minutes. "It struck me as awful funny
that we should come here to get up a woman's
club, and then have to call in a man the first
thing," she explained.</p>

<p>"Were not the <i>other sex</i> created physically
stronger than woman because it was intended that
they should perform just such labour?" Mrs.
Tweedie asked quickly, but before Mrs. Stout had
time to reply Mr. Tweedie came into the room.</p>

<p>"How can I serve you, ladies?" he asked as
he bowed low and smiled.</p>

<p>"Open a window, please," said Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear," Mr. Tweedie replied as
he went to a window, and, without any apparent
effort, raised it. "There you are," he said, smilingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"Anything else to-day?" (Once upon a
time Mr. Tweedie had been a salesman in a dry
goods store.)</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Tweedie replied, sharply. She was
displeased with him because of his untidy appearance,
and wished him to leave at once. He did
so, making some senseless remark about the
weather as he crossed the room on his way out.</p>

<p>"Now for goodness' sake let's begin," said
Mrs. Stout when the window was open and the
incident closed.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," echoed Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Tweedie began, "I have been
reading recently a treatise on parliamentary procedure,
and if I am not in error the selection of a
presiding officer should be our first business. Am
I not right, Miss Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Miss Sawyer. "And I do hope
that you will be our first president, Mrs. Tweedie."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am not competent," Mrs. Tweedie
protested, modestly.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mrs. Stout, "take the
place, we'll never get anything done if you don't."</p>

<p>"But, really&mdash;" Mrs. Tweedie insisted upon
weakly resisting.</p>

<p>"You, Mrs. Tweedie, above all others," interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mrs. Flint, "are the best qualified to lead
us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie appeared to be resigned to her fate.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she sighed, "that if you <i>all</i>
insist (there were three who represented the
ladies of Manville), it is my duty to comply with
your wishes. We will immediately proceed to
ballot."</p>

<p>"Ought we to hold a caucus?" inquired Miss
Sawyer while Mrs. Tweedie was passing paper
and pencils to the ladies.</p>

<p>"Why, what <i>is</i> a caucus?" asked Mrs. Tweedie
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"A caucus," replied Miss Sawyer, "is a meeting
held previous to an election. The men invariably
hold them."</p>

<p>"Then I am very sure that they are not proper,"
said Mrs. Tweedie, positively. "Do you know
anything about them, Mrs. Flint?"</p>

<p>The pastor's wife rolled her eyes skyward
before replying.</p>

<p>"I have heard Mr. Flint say that caucuses were
not proper for decent men to attend," she replied.</p>

<p>"And my husband," Mrs. Stout retorted,
quickly, "says that a caucus is the only place
where a vote counts."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"It surely cannot be necessary in a woman's
club," said Mrs. Tweedie. "Now if you will
write on your slips of paper the name of the one
whom you wish to be our president, I will appoint
Mrs. Stout a committee to collect and
count the ballots."</p>

<p>"All right, but I can't pass my hat," replied
Mrs. Stout, "because if I took it off I'd never
get it on straight again. Put them in my hand,
I promise not to look." Mrs. Stout proceeded
to collect and count the ballots.</p>

<p>"Ladies," said Mrs. Flint while they were
awaiting the result, "this is a day long to be remembered.
We have voted for the first time."</p>

<p>"But not the last," said Mrs. Stout, "our time
is comin'. Now if you're ready I'll tell you who's
been elected. Mrs. Tweedie has got all the votes
and is elected president. Speech!"</p>

<p>"Really," responded Mrs. Tweedie, "there is
no time for a speech even if I could make one. Of
course I am very grateful. We will now ballot
for a secretary and treasurer."</p>

<p>The performance of voting was twice again
enacted with the following result: Mrs. Stout was
elected treasurer, and for the office of secretary there
was a tie between Miss Sawyer and Mrs. Flint.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a conundrum for you to settle, Mis'
President," chuckled Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"I am sure that I have no idea what should be
done," replied Mrs. Tweedie, much perplexed.</p>

<p>"S'pose we call in Mr. Tweedie and let him
vote," suggested Mrs. Stout, who was bubbling
with mirth.</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" exclaimed Mrs. Tweedie.
"Give to one of the <i>other sex</i> the privilege of
suffrage in a woman's club? Never!"</p>

<p>"Never!" piped Mrs. Flint and Miss Sawyer
in chorus.</p>

<p>"Why not let the president vote again?" said
Mrs. Flint. "I am sure that I would willingly
abide by her decision. Would that method be
satisfactory to you, Miss Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I was about to suggest," replied Miss Sawyer,
"that I would gladly withdraw in your favour."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed, Miss Sawyer, I could not let
you make such a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Really, Mrs. Flint, it would be no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, don't speak of it again, I beg of you."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mrs. Flint, it seems to me that
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it is very good of you to say so, but
I really could not allow&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please, Mrs. Flint."</p>

<p>"No, in fact <i>I</i> insist upon withdrawing in your
favour. There, now please let us not say anything
more about it."</p>

<p>"That's right, give in, Miss Sawyer, we ain't
gettin' ahead fast enough to suit me," said Mrs.
Stout. Miss Sawyer succumbed with a sigh.
"Now," Mrs. Stout continued, "I'd like to ask
why nobody's made a motion."</p>

<p>"Motions are necessary," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
"when action on any question is contemplated.
The chair awaits a motion."</p>

<p>"Mis' President, I&mdash;" said Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout," gravely acknowledged Mrs.
Tweedie.</p>

<p>"I motion," continued Mrs. Stout, "that we
have a committee to get up some rules."</p>

<p>"It is MOVED" (Mrs. Tweedie said "moved"
in capitals, hoping that Mrs. Stout would profit
by it) "that a committee on rules be appointed.
Are you ready for the question?"</p>

<p>"There ain't any question about it as I can
see," said Mrs. Stout, indignantly. Mrs. Tweedie
patiently explained. Then the motion was "seconded,"
"put" (real man-fashion), and carried
unanimously, and Mrs. Stout, Mrs. Flint, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Miss Sawyer were appointed on the committee.</p>

<p>"Good land!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout when
the announcement was made, "I don't know
anything about makin' rules 'cept for boys. Can
I ask my husband to help?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Mrs. Tweedie, firmly.
"He would only laugh at you and us; besides, we
need no assistance from the <i>other sex</i>."</p>

<p>"Madam President," said Mrs. Flint as she
arose and smoothed down her dress. (Where
she got the "Madam President" idea no one
knew, but it pleased the ladies immensely.) "I
have read that in Congress they have a committee
on ways and means. Will it be necessary for us
to have a similar one?"</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" unceremoniously interrupted
the uncontrollable Mrs. Stout. "The
idea, and three of us married women with children.
I say that when our first baby was born we was
each of us appointed a committee on ways and
means by the Lord."</p>

<p>The laughter that followed was suddenly
terminated upon the second entrance of Tommy
Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Ma," he bellowed, "Dora slapped my face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and made my nose bleed, and pa laughed at me,
and said it served me right."</p>

<p>"My poor, dear, little son!" exclaimed Mrs.
Tweedie as she rushed to him. "Tell mother how
it happened," she added anxiously as she wiped
the blood from the little villain's face. Tommy
evaded the question by asking another.</p>

<p>"Can I have some cake now, ma?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may. Ladies, if you will excuse
me for a moment," said Mrs. Tweedie as
she and Tommy left the room in quest of revenge
and cake.</p>

<p>"Did you ever!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout after
the ladies had exchanged knowing glances for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I should say so!" piped Mrs. Flint. "I
knew that he behaved badly in Sabbath
school&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Tweedie's method the wisest?"
asked Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Well," whispered Mrs. Flint, "Mrs. Tweedie
is a <i>lovely</i> woman, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My experience is," interrupted Mrs. Stout,
"that all boys have got just so much bad and
noise in 'em, and if it don't come out one way
'twill another."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>This interesting chatter was cut short by the
return of Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Ladies," she said, "I must again apologize
for an irritating interruption. As I suspected,
Dora was wholly to blame. She had the audacity
to tell me that Thomas attempted to steal cake.
The idea, my son steal, and with such blood in
his veins."</p>

<p>"Folks that have boys must expect 'em to make
some trouble," said Mrs. Stout, and then turning
to Mrs. Flint, added, "I hear that your Willie's
come home from college."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Flint, as a pink flush
spread over her face, "William has returned, and
is soon to enter upon a mercantile career."</p>

<p>"Drivin' a wagon, or a job in the factory?"
asked Mrs. Stout, innocently. Mrs. Flint became
red with rage, Miss Sawyer was disgusted, and
Mrs. Tweedie mentally vowed that Mrs. Stout
should be gotten rid of, because if she continued
saying things there was no telling at what moment
the club would fly to pieces.</p>

<p>"It don't make much difference what a boy
works at," Mrs. Stout continued, wholly unaware
of the passion that she had aroused, "so long's
he don't do anything mean. I saw Willie Flint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
goin' by my house this mornin'&mdash;he was walkin'
with Miss Wallace, too, if anybody'd like to
know, they made a nice lookin' couple&mdash;and I
must say that he's a fine lookin' feller, too fine
lookin' to follow in his father's footprints. But
there, we're 'way off the track, ain't we?"</p>

<p>"We have digressed <i>slightly</i>," replied Mrs.
Tweedie, with icy sarcasm. "Our next business
will be the selection of a name for our organization.
Suppose that each of us suggest a name,
beginning with you, Miss Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Our meetings are to held in the morning&mdash;Wednesdays,
I suppose?" asked Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes; that was my intention," Mrs. Tweedie
replied. "It's a new idea, but if any of the ladies
object&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't object," interrupted Mrs. Stout, "only
it's a time of day when most of us ought to be
doin' somethin' else."</p>

<p>"I had thought," continued Miss Sawyer,
completely ignoring Mrs. Stout, "that 'The
Wednesday Morning Association' would be appropriate."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Mrs. Tweedie. "And what
do you suggest, Mrs. Flint?"</p>

<p>"My choice," replied Mrs. Flint, with her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
find on the ceiling, "would be 'The Manville
Anti-Male Club.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout snickered, whereupon the others
glared at her contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I feel that it is my duty to object, Mrs. Flint,
to your suggestion," Mrs. Tweedie began. "We
are all married&mdash;excepting one," she added,
with an apologizing smile for the benefit of Miss
Sawyer, who was blushing with embarrassment.
"Would the name be appropriate when we consider
that our life companions are of the <i>other
sex</i>? Would it not reflect on our judgment in
choosing a career in married life?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we didn't choose," said Mrs. Stout,
quickly. "Perhaps&mdash;" there is no telling what
Mrs. Stout would have said if she had not been
interrupted by the entrance of a plump, pink-faced
young woman.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Thornton!" exclaimed Mrs.
Tweedie, as she advanced to greet the newcomer.
"I am <i>so</i> glad that you came. Ladies: Mrs.
Thornton. You are just in time to assist us in
the naming of our club. How is that dear
baby?"</p>

<p>"Teething," replied Mrs. Thornton, sadly, as
she sat down.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's too bad," said Mrs. Tweedie, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm all worn out, and I can't find a thing
for the poor child to eat that agrees with him."</p>

<p>"What have you tried?" Miss Sawyer asked,
wishing to show some interest, though she knew
nothing of babies or their food.</p>

<p>"Everything," replied the perplexed mother.
"Last week my husband brought home from town
a dozen samples of prepared foods; we have tried
them all, but baby's stomach is still in a wretched
condition."</p>

<p>"Samples," sniffed Mrs. Stout, contemptuously.
"Have you tried cow's milk?"</p>

<p>"The idea!" the ladies exclaimed, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it ain't fashionable," Mrs. Stout
retorted, "but I've learned from experience that
cow's milk comes next to the best thing for babies."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, ladies," said Mrs. Tweedie, "but
I must call your attention to the fact that, admitting
at the same time the necessity for babies, our club
is still nameless. Mrs. Thornton, what name
do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," replied Mrs. Thornton, "don't ask
me. I'm too tired to think. Whatever name is
chosen will suit me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Fanny Tweedie rushed into the room
with the energy of an infant cyclone. Mrs.
Tweedie gazed in astonishment at her pretty,
light-headed, light-hearted, impulsive daughter,
as though her entrance was out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>"Why, Fanny!" she exclaimed. "What has
detained you?"</p>

<p>"I've been over to Gertrude's to see her wedding
things," Fanny replied, in a rather disrespectful
manner, without noticing who was present,
and then, in her quick, impulsive way, continued:
"They're just <i>lovely</i>! Really, I never saw such
awfully swell things before <i>anywhere</i>. She ought
to be happy if any girl ever was. I couldn't <i>begin</i>
to tell you about them in a week; and&mdash; Oh, I
heard the worst stories about Billy Fl&mdash;!" A
warning look on her mother's face stopped Fanny
on the edge of a precipice. But Billy Fl&mdash;'s
mother guessed&mdash;so did the others. Mrs.
Tweedie came quickly to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Fanny," she said, "we are trying to find a
name for our club; please save your stories for
another time. Mrs. Stout, have you any suitable
name in mind?"</p>

<p>"How would 'The Manville Woman's Club'
do?" replied Mrs. Stout.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good," said Mrs. Tweedie, "only I am
prejudiced in regard to the name of our town;
it is so suggestive of the <i>other sex</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mrs. Stout, "we've all tried,
now what do you think we ought to call ourselves,
Mis' Tweedie?"</p>

<p>"I have considered the matter with care," replied
Mrs. Tweedie. "Many names have come
into my mind, but for one reason or another, all
excepting one were rejected. The one that appeals
to me as being the most appropriate and beautifully
poetic is 'The Morning Glory Club.'"</p>

<p>"Beautiful," murmured the ladies, excepting
Mrs. Stout, who laughed until her fat body shook.</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>," she said, as soon as she could
control her mirth. "It's an awful pretty name,
but what a beautiful bunch of morning glories us
old women will make." If the ladies had been
profane what opportunities Mrs. Stout had given
them. She continued to laugh, however, despite
their frowns.</p>

<p>"Madam President," said Miss Sawyer, when
Mrs. Stout's laughter had subsided to a gurgling
chuckle. "The name that you have suggested
is admirable. The only question in my mind is
concerning the word 'club.' Is 'club' more appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
than association, or some other
word?"</p>

<p>"You might say congregation," replied Mrs.
Stout, "or aggregation."</p>

<p>"Club," replied Mrs. Tweedie, "is the term
generally used, I believe, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What difference does it make, anyway?"
Mrs. Stout interrupted. "We'll never get anything
done if we don't 'tend to business better'n
we have. We've done about as much in two hours
as the men would have done in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Indeed," retorted Mrs. Tweedie, "but would
they have done it as well?" She asked the question
in tones approaching anger. (Blue blood
boils at 180&deg; F.)</p>

<p>"Better," snapped Mrs. Stout, who was fast
losing patience.</p>

<p>"And why?" pressed Mrs. Tweedie, determined
this time to utterly squelch Mrs. Stout if
such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>"Because," replied Mrs. Stout, "they wouldn't
have talked about everything under the sun while
they was doin' it."</p>

<p>"No, my dear Mrs. Stout" (Mrs. Tweedie
knew the irony of "my dear" perfectly), "it
would be because the <i>other sex</i> are more experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
than woman. And they are more experienced
because for centuries it has been their exclusive
right to organize and govern. In the meantime,
we women have been kept under foot and in
darkness."</p>

<p>"Good land!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, "perhaps
<i>you</i> have been stepped on, Mis' Tweedie, but
I'm mighty sure that <i>I</i> ain't! It would take an
awful big foot to keep me in darkness." An embarrassing
silence followed, after which Mrs.
Tweedie put the question, on motion of Miss
Sawyer, and the name, "The Morning Glory
Club," was adopted unanimously. At the moment
Mrs. Tweedie announced, "It is a vote,"
Ezra Tweedie, unmistakably labouring under
some great excitement, appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown, next door, needs you at once,"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the ladies in a stage whisper.
Mrs. Tweedie alone seemed not to understand.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she demanded, forgetting
for the moment those present. Ezra
blushed, and looked about for some means of
escape. (What foolishly sensitive, over modest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
fools we all are at times.) "Why don't you answer?"
Mrs. Tweedie almost thundered.</p>

<p>"It's a new baby!" Ezra blurted, and then fled.</p>

<p>The Morning Glory Club adjourned without
form.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon when Mrs. Tweedie returned
home she found Ezra asleep on a couch in
the sitting-room, while in the kitchen her son,
Thomas, and two of his chums, were trying to tar
and feather a fourth urchin with molasses and the
contents of a pillow. The uplifting of our morals
and intellect is trying, and some personal sacrifice
is necessary, she thought, as she drove the boys
out of the house, and awoke her sleeping husband.</p>

<p>"Where's Dora?" she asked, when Ezra sat up
and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I," he yawned. "Dora? Oh, she asked
me if she could go out for a few moments, and I
gave my consent. I hope, my dear, that I was
right in so doing."</p>

<p>"Right? Certainly not, Ezra. How are we
to have any dinner? The fire is out, Dora is
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you have been out," Ezra chuckled.</p>

<p>"Three out&mdash;all out!" yelled Thomas. "And
say, ma, I'm awful hungry."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Man and a Woman</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the same day that the Morning Glory Club
was born, it happened that Will Flint met Barbara
Wallace on her way to school, and he eagerly
grasped the opportunity to renew a friendship
which had begun at Barbara's home, in his college
town, a year before she came to Manville.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad to see you, Miss Wallace,"
he said, with boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she replied. "And may I ask
how you happen to be at home at this time in the
year?"</p>

<p>The smile on his face disappeared.</p>

<p>"I'll walk with you a few minutes if you don't
mind, and try to explain," he said. Will tried to
tell the truth and spare himself at the same time,
but did neither well.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, and in your senior year, too," said
Barbara, when he had finished.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the worst part of the whole affair.
I&mdash;I don't know why I told you, Miss Wallace,
but you asked me, and&mdash;you see I don't have
any one to tell such things to&mdash;never did. I don't
mean to be disrespectful, but father has spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
his life trying to save sinners by preaching&mdash;somehow
it didn't work on me; and mother, she's
good, of course, but&mdash;I can't say it just the way
I want to&mdash;I guess it's sympathy I need."</p>

<p>Barbara knew that his earnestness was genuine,
but the timidity and hesitancy of the big fellow
amused her.</p>

<p>"One can do very little without it," she said,
trying to refrain from laughter, and then quickly
added: "I suppose that you have already planned
for the future."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't decided what I shall do&mdash;hardly
thought of it, in fact. I shall stay at home
for awhile, and then&mdash;I don't know&mdash;there's
nothing I'm fitted for. I suppose that I might
saw wood, or work on the roads."</p>

<p>"That would never do for a clergyman's son,"
replied Barbara.</p>

<p>"Would be rather funny, wouldn't it? Anyway,
I've got nothing else to do at present except
think about it&mdash;I guess something will turn
up."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to find something yourself
instead of waiting for it to come to you?"</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Miss Wallace; but here's
your school and forty kids waiting for teacher to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
let them in. I won't forget your question. Good-bye."
Will raised his cap and walked away.</p>

<p>The children loved Barbara, and usually ran
to meet her like a drove of stampeded animals,
but on this morning, when they saw her coming
accompanied by a stranger, they remained huddled
on the steps of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>"Who's that man?" one of the little girls asked
when Barbara arrived within speaking distance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flint," she replied, with her usual candour.</p>

<p>"Is he a real good man?" piped another.
Barbara was not sure, but did not wish to say so.
Without making a reply she unlocked the door
and went in, followed by her flock, and was soon
deep in the morning's work: trying to make the
youngsters believe that the earth is round, explaining
such perplexing words as pare, pear, and pair,
and proving that twelve times twelve makes one
hundred and forty-four,&mdash;if you do it right.</p>

<p>During the day the question that the little girl
had asked, "Is he a real good man?" frequently
came into Barbara's mind. She did not know the
answer, and wondered why she thought of it at all.</p>

<p>Miss Wallace boarded with Mrs. Tweedie.
She was a quiet little woman, but one whose appearance
and personality had been, for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
unexplainable reason, the cause of not a little
comment among the people of Manville. Her
eyes&mdash;Mrs. Tweedie thought that blue eyes
lacked strength; and her hair did not please Mrs.
Doctor Jones because it was neither yellow nor
red. According to Mrs. Thornton's standard for
feminine contours, her form was "positively
dumpy;" and everybody knew that Mrs. Deacon
Walton had told Mrs. Undertaker Blake, confidentially,
that she "always suspicioned folks
that didn't have any more to say about things and
people than Miss Wallace did." Many other
women were of the same opinion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the men who knew her
thought that she was the right sort; and those who
were not acquainted wished that they were. Mr.
Tweedie especially was captivated by her quiet
manner, and did everything possible for her comfort;
and Barbara&mdash;perhaps it was because she
pitied him&mdash;showed in many ways her appreciation
of his thoughtfulness. Thomas, the "Tweedie
Indian," as he was sometimes appropriately called,
declared that "She's the best teacher in town, but
when she licks a feller it hurts." Men and women
will disagree sometimes&mdash;especially about another
woman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no real sympathy between Mrs.
Tweedie and her boarder, but Barbara was a
college graduate, and Mrs. Tweedie had heard
that her family was of the best. Education and
blood Mrs. Tweedie worshipped. If the devil
had presented himself to her with his family
history under his arm she would have welcomed
him. Besides, taking boarders is a much more
genteel way of piecing out an insufficient income
than taking in washing.</p>

<p>Fanny Tweedie thought that Barbara was an
awfully nice girl; though she was forced to admit
after an acquaintance of two years that she did
not wholly understand her. And Barbara liked
Fanny because, though somewhat frivolous, she
was companionable and amusing.</p>

<p>Barbara tolerated Mrs. Tweedie because boarding
places in Manville were scarce. She did not
care for the town, and disliked especially the
manners of most of its people; but she kept her
opinions to herself; which, as has been intimated,
did not increase her popularity with the women.</p>

<p>Will Flint, son of the Rev. Elijah Flint, was a
big, manly-looking fellow who might have been
a greater success at college if his parents had not
held the reins so tightly when he was a boy at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
home. His father had preached him a thousand
sermons, and his mother had wept gallons of
tears; yet here was the object of their labour at
home in disgrace, his career at college ruined in
his senior year.</p>

<p>Both said that Will had decided to leave college
and engage in some sort of business. He had
left, but to say that <i>he</i> decided to leave was as
far from the truth as right from wrong. The faculty
decided, Will left. He was not all to blame,
and nothing dishonourable had been done, but
his frank explanations did not assuage in the
slightest degree the grief of his parents. The disgrace
in their eyes was an indelible stain, and
a gloom that was deep and black had reigned
in the parsonage since the day of his arrival.
Outside, tongues were wagging at a furious rate.
The sons and daughters of the clergy seem to
be the special prey of gossips. They are supposed
to be impervious to temptation, something
better than the ordinary human. We forget that
the same God made them that made the children
of the butcher and the baker.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, after Barbara had sent
the last little urchin homeward, she stood at a
window looking out over the fields at the autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
foliage of the woods beyond. She had been there
but a moment when Will Flint came down the
road and turned into the path that led to the
schoolhouse. When he saw her he stopped.
Barbara did not know whether she was pleased or
not to see him. It was time to go, however, so
she put on her things, went out and locked the
door, and started down the path.</p>

<p>"Hope you won't be vexed, Miss Wallace,
because I came," said Will, "but I've been so
confoundedly lonesome to-day that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not vexed," she said, quickly. His
manner and frankness pleased her, and dispelled
the doubt that was in her mind a moment before.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," he said as they turned and walked
toward home. "The boys that I knew," he continued,
"have gone away to work, or school. That
is why I'm lonesome I suppose, and then the place
seems different."</p>

<p>"But it's not," replied Barbara, and a smile
played about her lips. He was only a big boy,
after all.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be smaller and shabbier."</p>

<p>"Things," said Barbara, "grow old like men
and women."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but&mdash;I can't seem to say things
the way I want to. I've been in the woods all day
tramping and thinking; it's done me a lot of good,
but&mdash;I guess I won't talk about myself any
longer."</p>

<p>"But I am interested," said Barbara, earnestly,
and then added, quickly, "in anybody who is
perplexed."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but at present I'm nobody. I
have yet to earn the right to be anybody, much
less somebody."</p>

<p>"Very well, if you insist we will drop Mr.
Flint."</p>

<p>"I wish that we could drop him out of sight for
good," said Will, bitterly.</p>

<p>"What a wicked thought."</p>

<p>"If my thoughts&mdash;" Will checked himself
suddenly and then asked: "Can't we find something
else to talk about? I have it, the new
woman's club, have you been invited to join?"</p>

<p>"The <i>new</i> woman's club?" said Barbara,
feigning surprise. "I had not heard of it."</p>

<p>"You're making fun of me."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is you who are trying to joke at our
expense."</p>

<p>"No, really, Miss Wallace, I meant the woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
club that mother and the rest are getting up.
Are you going to join?"</p>

<p>"Yes; do you approve of such things?"</p>

<p>"Really, I&mdash;I don't know, and yet I ought to
know something about it because father and
mother have been debating the question for a
week past. Mother is very enthusiastic, but my
impression is that father thinks that the club is
unnecessary if not really harmful. I shall expect
a great boom in Manville society when it gets in
running order," Will replied, and then suddenly
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Tell me, please, I want to laugh, too."</p>

<p>"Manville society! Doesn't it strike you as
being funny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no."</p>

<p>"A woman's answer."</p>

<p>"Sometimes her only defence."</p>

<p>"Pardon me."</p>

<p>The October sun was disappearing behind the
trees toward the west; the night air was stealing
up from the lowlands; and a frost-laden wind
was coming over the hills.</p>

<p>"Isn't the air great?" said Will after they had
walked without speaking for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" replied Barbara, taking a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
breath. "The fall is glorious." They had
reached Mrs. Tweedie's gate and stopped.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you, Miss Wallace, for&mdash;"
Will hesitated a moment, "for tolerating me
to-day." Then he added, "Good night!" and
walked quickly away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie happened to look out of her
parlour window just in time to see Barbara and
Will. The sight caused her to shrug her shoulders
and wonder.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Male Gossip</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sam Billings</span> was Manville's man of all work,
and its most garrulous male gossip. At fifty he
was a gray, wrinkled bachelor&mdash;through no fault
of his own, however&mdash;living alone on the scanty
income that he picked up through the kindness
of his tolerant townsmen. Once Sam had been
accused of having proposed to every single woman
and widow in town, and had refused to deny or
affirm the statement. He was still single, however,
and as far from matrimony as he ever had
been, except once, when through a misunderstanding
on Sam's part, he became engaged to a
loquacious old maid with whom he had indiscreetly
walked home from meeting. But, fortunately
for Sam, the lady died just before the
date set for the wedding, leaving him free and
more talkative than ever before.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day following the organization
of the "Morning Glories" Sam went to
the home of Mrs. Darling to put on storm-windows.
Mrs. Darling was an attractive woman&mdash;to look
at&mdash;but one of the light sort mentally, and much
more interested in the affairs of others than her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
own. She had been invited to be present at the
first meeting of the club, but the arrival of relatives
from out of town had prevented her from going.
She welcomed Sam cordially, when he came that
morning, and invited him to have a cup of coffee
before he began work. The morning was cold,
the coffee good, and Sam was grateful, and before
he had gulped down the last of it Mrs. Darling
knew all that was going on in town.</p>

<p>"So Mrs. Browning has a baby at last?" she
said as Sam wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Boy, or a girl?"</p>

<p>"One, or t'other, I forget which."</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p>"Yep, broke up the meetin' of the club so I
heard."</p>

<p>"How dreadfully funny."</p>

<p>"And they say that Ezra Tweedie put his foot
in it."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"Why, he was the one that broke the glad news
to the gatherin'."</p>

<p>"Oh. What did you say they named the
club?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Four-o'clocks, or petunias&mdash;somethin' like
that, it was the name of a flower anyway, I don't
jest remember which."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Tweedie was chosen president?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew she'd be."</p>

<p>"Who was it, did you say, that told you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I stopped in at the grocery on my way
over, and then I had a bundle to take to Miss
Sawyer's, and&mdash;Tommy Tweedie told me the
rest. Now I guess I'll start in on the winders if
you don't mind. I'm in a little mite of a hurry
'cause I've got to go over to Mis' Walton's this
afternoon and give her a coat of paint."</p>

<p>"Very well, you'll find the windows in the
attic," said Mrs. Darling, reluctantly. "Oh,
you said that you were at Miss Sawyer's this
morning, how is she?"</p>

<p>"Lookin' pretty fair," replied Sam with some
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I thought that <i>you</i> ought to know."</p>

<p>"Where'd you say them storm-winders was?"
Sam asked in an effort to change the subject.</p>

<p>"In the attic. Miss Sawyer would make somebody
a good wife."</p>

<p>"I think likely, but&mdash;" Sam edged toward
the door.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've heard, Sam, that you've been going there
lately, and that you did not always have a bundle
to deliver."</p>

<p>"You're kind of teasin', Mis' Darling, ain't
yer?" replied Sam with a grin as he backed out
of the room and went up-stairs in search of the
storm-windows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling was not wholly satisfied with
second-hand news, so she ran into Mrs. Thornton's,
next door; and, while the baby with a new
tooth was having his morning "sample," his
mamma related her version of the story of the
first meeting of the club.</p>

<p>In order to put on the front chamber windows,
it was necessary for Sam to get out on the roof of
the piazza. Just as he was climbing out of a
window, Alick Purbeck, Mr. Stout's clerk, drove
up, and when he saw Sam stopped.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam," he called, "what you doin' up
there?"</p>

<p>"Workin' for my health; doctor says I've got
to have three meals a day."</p>

<p>"Doctor nothin'."</p>

<p>"No, Doctor Jones."</p>

<p>"Say, what's this I hear about Billy Flint?"</p>

<p>"Not knowin', I hesitate to say." Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Darling's coffee had put Sam in a facetious
mood.</p>

<p>"There was a man lookin' for him over to the
store half an hour ago," said Alick, gravely.</p>

<p>"What d' he have, a bill or a warrant?"</p>

<p>"Dunno."</p>

<p>"I hope Billy ain't in any scrape."</p>

<p>"Same here."</p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' crooked about him."</p>

<p>"That's what I say, but there's lots of folks in
town that'll believe anything, 'specially now he's
goin' 'round with Miss Wallace some, same's I
heard this mornin' he was doin'."</p>

<p>"She's all right, too," said Sam, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"You bet," replied Alick. "Did you hear
about the woman's club?"</p>

<p>"Some."</p>

<p>"What they goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Well," Sam drawled, "near's I can make
out, they're goin' to improve themselves, where
there's room for improvement, and scatter blessin's
'round to other folks while they're doin' it. I
heard that yesterday they voted ten dollars for a
pink tea, and one dollar seventy-five for foreign
missions, and&mdash;" Sam was interrupted by Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Stout, who had approached unobserved by either
of the gossipers.</p>

<p>"You're lyin', Sam Billin's," she called, sharply.
It was evident that she had overheard Sam's
remarks.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mis' Stout," called Sam, unabashed, as
he peeked over the edge of the roof. "I hear
you're a bright and shinin' light in <i>our</i> new club."</p>

<p>"Don't you let me hear of you tellin' any more
such whoppers, Sam Billin's. Lies breed fast
enough in this town without any extra help from
you," replied Mrs. Stout, as she looked up at his
grinning face, and then turning to Alick, continued,
"Ain't you got anything else to do, Alick Purbeck,
'cept sit behind a big cigar and listen to that
shiftless critter up there? Go 'long now, or I'll
talk your case over with Peter."</p>

<p>Alick drove away, and Sam went to work. Mrs.
Stout started on her way, but had gone only a
few steps when she met Mrs. Darling returning
from Mrs. Thornton's.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Stout," she said, "I'm
so glad to see you, aren't you out early?"</p>

<p>"Good land! no; I'm goin' over to see your
friend Mis' Thornton about her baby. Everybody's
s'posed to be foolish over their first baby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
but I guess from what I heard yesterday that she's
overdoin' it. She's feedin' him on samples&mdash;turns
up her nose at cow's milk&mdash;and I just made up
my mind that she needed a talkin' to whether she
wanted it or not."</p>

<p>"No doubt you are right, Mrs. Stout, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right, I know I am&mdash;such nonsense. Of
course you folks that ain't had no children, and
don't want any, can't be expected to&mdash;" Mrs.
Stout stopped suddenly and looked up. Sam was
looking and listening with the earnest attention
of an incurable gossip.</p>

<p>"Eavesdroppin', are you?" said Mrs. Stout,
contemptuously, and then turning to Mrs. Darling
added, "Don't you believe one word that scallywag
up there tells you. He gets his news from
wash-women and servant girls."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Sam, "I've noticed that what
you hear at back doors is most always nearer the
truth than what you hear at the front, though it
ain't quite so flatterin'."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The "Glories" Meet Again</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Wednesday, and the morning was as
bright and beautiful as the flower for which the
new club had been named.</p>

<p>Across the road from Mr. Flint's church stood
the dingy white parsonage, its windows glistening
in the morning sunlight. It was there, and on
this particular morning, that the second meeting
of the "Glories" was to be held.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint, with the apprehensiveness of a neat
housekeeper, was trotting from one room to
another, replacing a chair here, raising or lowering
a curtain a fraction of an inch there, and now and
then wiping away an imaginary spot of dust.</p>

<p>Will Flint was looking out one of the sitting-room
windows, and rocking nervously with one
leg thrown over the arm of his chair. He wanted
to smoke and read, but smoking was not to be
thought of in the parsonage.</p>

<p>"What's going to happen, mother?" he asked,
as she came into the sitting-room in search of
disorder and dust.</p>

<p>"Our club is to meet here this morning," Mrs.
Flint replied, proudly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess I'll go for a walk," said Will, as he
got up, stretched his arms, and yawned.</p>

<p>"I had hoped," sighed Mrs. Flint, regretfully,
"that you would stay at home and meet the
ladies."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, mother, I guess I'll be safer
out-of-doors," he replied, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Will," said Mrs. Flint, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, mother dear, I'm sorry
to disappoint you, but&mdash;a houseful of women,
it's impossible!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint suppressed another sigh. Since her
son's return from college she could not accustom
herself to his ways. She wanted to say, "Willie,
be sure and return in time for dinner," but she
realized that the boy had become a man, and
remained silent.</p>

<p>"I'll be home in time for supper," said Will,
as he took his hat and started for the door,
then added, "Good luck, mother," and went
out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint watched from the window, as
he walked down the path and up the road, until
he disappeared. She was about to turn away from
the window when Mrs. Stout waddled into view,
stopped in front of the parsonage, hailed Alick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Purbeck, who was driving by, and the following
conversation, which Mrs. Flint and all of her
neighbours could hear, took place.</p>

<p>"How's your folks, Alick?" asked Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Children ain't well."</p>

<p>"Too bad, what doctor've you got?"</p>

<p>"Jones."</p>

<p>"He don't know nothin'."</p>

<p>"He did my wife a lot of good."</p>

<p>"He don't understand children."</p>

<p>"Well, I've had him twice, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take my advice and get another."</p>

<p>"I'll see."</p>

<p>"Has Sam Billin's been tellin' you any more
trash about the woman's club?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. Get-ap."</p>

<p>The grocer's wagon rattled off down the street,
and Mrs. Stout went to the door and rang the bell.
Mrs. Flint was disgusted, but succeeded in concealing
her feelings, and greeted Mrs. Stout
smilingly.</p>

<p>"You are punctual, Mrs. Stout," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," puffed Mrs. Stout, "I always make it
a point to be on time; it pays and don't cost
anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, come right in, punctuality is indeed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
virtue, but one that is unappreciated by those who
do not possess it."</p>

<p>"I declare," said Mrs. Stout, as she plumped
into a chair, "I do believe I'm gettin' wheezy
in my old age, just that little walk from my house
has tuckered me out. How's the club gettin'
along?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly, over twenty ladies have signified
their intention to be present this morning. The
committee on rules has completed its work&mdash;oh,
by the way, you were on that committee, Mrs.
Stout. Did you get my postal in regard to the
meeting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I couldn't come. I'll agree to what
you and Miss Sawyer have done, though."</p>

<p>"Very good of you, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"But you can't make women live by rule, any
more'n you can mix cats and dogs without there
bein' some fightin'." This remark wounded Mrs.
Flint's cultured feelings, but before there was
time to think of a fitting reply, Mrs. Stout, who
was looking out of a window, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here's Miss Sawyer! and if she ain't walkin'
with that gossipy old bach', Sam Billin's. I
thought she was <i>awful</i> perticler about the company
she kept."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say their meeting was purely casual,"
observed Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"Most prob'ly," said Mrs. Stout, "but you
know how folks will talk."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint did know, furthermore, she thought,
that some folks talked more than others. Their
conversation came to an end upon the entrance
of Miss Sawyer, and the arrival of several other
ladies in rapid succession. Among them was
Mrs. Tweedie, who had Mrs. Doctor Jones in
tow. Mrs. Jones was a meek little woman with a
mind as changeable as a weather-vane, but she was
a patient, willing worker, one of the sort always
to be found washing dishes after a supper at the
church long after her more brilliant sisters had
gone home. Mrs. Tweedie always made friends
of such women; they were useful, and seldom
caused trouble. Another of the new members
was Mrs. Deacon Walton, who lived on the edge
of the town&mdash;"in the country," some of the
village ladies said. Mrs. Walton was not sure that
membership in a woman's club would be pleasing,
proper, or profitable, but was willing to try it.</p>

<p>The ladies were all well acquainted, and immediately
began talking in a delightfully happy
manner. As the number increased, so did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
chatter, which soon resembled the sounds of a
bird store. Mrs. Tweedie, for a long time silent
and thoughtful, gazed upon the gathering with
pride. Success such as she had never dreamed
of was within her grasp. Every woman who had
been invited to come was present&mdash;wives of the
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker,
all were there, and at the signal for silence stopped
talking and looked expectantly at their leader.
Mrs. Tweedie looked over the assemblage gravely
and leisurely before beginning to speak.</p>

<p>"Ladies of The Morning Glory Club," she
began, "the founders of our organization would
be indeed ungrateful if they did not appreciate
the generous response to their appeal by so many
of the first ladies of our town. We thank you,
and, I must add, hope that you will concur with
us in what has been done at a previous meeting.
The records of the last meeting will be read by
our secretary."</p>

<p>Miss Sawyer timidly complied with the president's
request, reading from a neatly written
manuscript of daintily tinted and perfumed notepaper,
the sheets of which were fastened together
by a pale green ribbon. When Miss Sawyer had
finished, the committee on rules presented their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
report in the form of a constitution and by-laws,
which were accepted without debate. Then Mrs.
Tweedie suggested that committees on ethics,
art, literature, and the Lord knows what, be
appointed. It was done. Everything that Mrs.
Tweedie desired came to pass. She was in the
clouds; never, even in her dreams, had she thought
such power possible.</p>

<p>For an hour the meeting progressed, and during
that time Mrs. Stout, for some unfathomable
reason, remained silent. When she did rise to
speak, she addressed the chair in such a perfectly
proper manner that, for a moment, the ladies
thought that by some strange process she had
become civilized.</p>

<p>"Ladies," she said, "I'm treasurer of this
club, and I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' since
our last meetin'. We've got to have some money,
and it'll take for ever and a day for dues at ten
cents a month to amount to anything. We've
got to run some kind of a show to raise money.
This ethical and e-comical business is all right,
but what we want now is dollars!"</p>

<p>"A very good suggestion," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
who was feeling amiable enough at that moment
even to agree with one whom she disliked. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
ladies murmured their approval. "The chair
awaits suggestions," continued Mrs. Tweedie.
Upon that they, the suggestions, came like an
avalanche&mdash;everything was proposed from a
spelling-match to military whist. But Mrs. Tweedie
frowned upon them all; only something new
to Manville would suit her. She desired above all
things to get as far away as possible from the
provincial ways of the town.</p>

<p>"Whatever we give will cost something,"
remarked Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p>"We can't spend any money if we haven't got
any," squeaked the deacon's wife.</p>

<p>"Assuredly not," replied Mrs. Tweedie. "The
question is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not settle this money business first,"
interrupted Mrs. Stout. "Mis' Darling says
we've got to spend money whatever we do. I
say we ain't, what we've got to buy we can get
trusted for&mdash;everybody else does."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Mrs. Doctor Jones, warmly,
"they do, and sometimes for a long time." The
wives of the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick
maker looked as though they would like to
say "amen." Others moved uneasily, until
Mrs. Tweedie came to the rescue.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"The question is," she said, firmly, "what
sort of an entertainment shall be given, not how
we are to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Madam President," some one said from a
corner.</p>

<p>"Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;" Mrs. Tweedie craned her
neck to see who had spoken. "Oh, Mrs. Thornton."</p>

<p>"What would the ladies say to theatricals?"
asked the woman with a baby.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Fanny Tweedie. "A
play, the very thing, what a sweet idea."</p>

<p>"Fanny," said her mother, reprovingly, yet
she liked the idea herself.</p>

<p>"A play!" gasped Mrs. Flint, in dismay.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think favourably of the
idea," replied Mrs. Tweedie, turning to the
parson's wife.</p>

<p>"But the Church, Mrs. Tweedie, have you
forgotten what we owe to our creed?" asked
Mrs. Flint, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed," said Mrs. Tweedie, with a
benevolent smile, "but the barriers between the
stage and the Church are not so high as they
were."</p>

<p>"They ain't so high," added Mrs. Stout, "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
what most folks can peek over if they stand on
tiptoes, and their minister ain't lookin'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flint felt certain that the end of all things
was at hand.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," she said, "I have no idea what
Mr. Flint will say."</p>

<p>"What difference would it make?" Mrs.
Stout asked, bluntly. This remark was followed
by the most embarrassing, painful silence in the
history of the club.</p>

<p>When business was resumed, it was voted
that a committee of five be appointed to select a
play, and plan for its production.</p>

<p>The Reverend and Mrs. Flint had a long talk
that night.</p>

<p>"And the unholy suggestion was made and
adopted in my home!" thundered the reverend,
forgetting that his audience consisted of only one.</p>

<p>Manville was waking up.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Stouts at Home</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Stouts were common folks&mdash;most of us
are, for that matter, in one way or another. Excepting
Sundays, Mr. Stout ate his meals with the
frock on that he wore at the store; he used his
knife at table in a manner not prescribed by
etiquette; and at all times his English was at
variance with the best authority. But in his dealings
with men he was as honest as his wife in her
speech, and made money despite customers who
did not pay their bills. His three sons were
healthy urchins, who obeyed and respected their
parents&mdash;just like other boys.</p>

<p>"How's that new club gettin' along?" Mr.
Stout asked his wife while they were at supper
on the day of the meeting at the parsonage.</p>

<p>"Fine; I ain't enjoyed myself for years the way
I do at them meetin's," replied Mrs. Stout,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"There won't be any need of a newspaper here
now," observed her husband without looking up
from his plate.</p>

<p>"I expected to hear you say somethin' like
that," replied Mrs. Stout. "But I want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
understand just this much, Peter Stout; that
club's goin' to be the talk of the town, and do
more for it than any crowd of men have ever done
so far."</p>

<p>"Won't have to do much," grunted Peter, with
his mouth full of beefsteak.</p>

<p>"You're just right about that. This town has
got the laziest set of men, outside of their own
affairs, that I ever heard of. When they're through
work for the day, they just set 'round and smoke,
and tell each other that the town ain't the same
as it used to be; and that this thing would be
done, or that thing 'tended to, if the right men
was in office. Who elects the selectmen, I should
like to know? And then they talk about who's
goin' to be the next President, and who's goin'
to be next governor, and let the town that they
live in, that's right under their lazy noses day and
night, go to rack and ruin. I say the right way
is to do <i>somethin'</i> even if you make a mess of
it tryin'."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" cried Peter, as he clapped his
hands. "That's a great speech, Emmy, and all
true."</p>

<p>"True, I guess it is, true as gospel," replied
Mrs. Stout, and then turning on her oldest son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
asked, sharply, "Henry Warren Stout, are you
eatin' butter on bread, or bread on butter?"
Before the boy had time to reply he was hit in the
eye with a bread pill from the hand of Paul Jones,
whereupon Wendell Phillips fell off his chair
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>"We're goin' to give a play," said Mrs. Stout,
after she had boxed Paul Jones's ears, and the
commotion had ceased.</p>

<p>"A play!" Peter put down his knife and fork,
masticated and swallowed the food that was in
his mouth, and sat staring at his wife in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Stout, "and we're all goin'
to be in it. It'll be the biggest thing this town
ever saw or heard of."</p>

<p>"You, goin' on the stage?" said Peter, with
a grin, and then he gave way to hearty laughter.</p>

<p>"I don't see what there is to laugh about,
Peter Stout; ain't we got as much right to give a
play as anybody?" asked Mrs. Stout, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all right, and if the play is as funny
as the idea, it'll make a hit," said Peter, his mirth
subsiding.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"It ain't goin' to be funny," retorted Mrs.
Stout. "It's goin' to be a classic."</p>

<p>"A classic," he repeated, wonderingly. "What's
that?"</p>

<p>"A classic," replied Mrs. Stout, knowingly,
"is somethin' you ought to know about, and&mdash;and
don't."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Peter, still in doubt.</p>

<p>"I hope you're satisfied now."</p>

<p>"I guess so; I'll wait till I've seen the play
before I say anything more about it."</p>

<p>"I guess you'd better," said Mrs. Stout, triumphantly.
"Paul Jones, take your fingers out
of that sauce." Paul Jones obeyed, and licked
the sauce from his fingers.</p>

<p>"Ma, is your club goin' to have a ball-nine?"
asked Wendell Phillips. He played first base on
the Manville Juveniles, which was the only club
he knew anything about.</p>

<p>"No, we ain't, Wendell," his mother replied.
"Don't you boys get any silly notions about clubs
into your heads."</p>

<p>"Ma'd make a bully catcher," suggested Henry
Warren.</p>

<p>"Stop your nonsense about baseball or you'll
all go to bed," commanded Mrs. Stout, in a tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that the youngsters could not fail to understand.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was broken by the
ringing of the door-bell. The boys jumped
from their chairs and started on a race for the
door.</p>

<p>"Boys!" said Mrs. Stout, sharply, and the three
came to a sudden stop. "Set down." They
obeyed, and wistfully watched their mother as
she started for the front door.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Wallace!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout
when she opened the door and saw who was there.
"Come right in."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Miss Wallace, "but I
haven't time. I called to ask if Henry was feeling
any better."</p>

<p>"Better?" Mrs. Stout did not understand.</p>

<p>"I hope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He ain't any better'n he ought to be, nor any
worse'n some other boys I know of," said Mrs.
Stout.</p>

<p>"But is he not sick?" asked Miss Wallace.</p>

<p>"Sick? Good land! No; he's eatin' his supper
now," replied Mrs. Stout. Miss Wallace sighed,
some one had been lying. "Who said he was
sick?" asked Mrs. Stout, suspiciously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I understood&mdash;" Miss Wallace began, and
then hesitated for a moment. "He was absent
this afternoon," she continued, "and I understood
Paul and Wendell to say that he was
sick."</p>

<p>"Absent was he, from school?" said Mrs.
Stout. "And them two boys lied about it? It
won't happen again, Miss Wallace." At that
moment a man walked past. Mrs. Stout peered
into the darkness for a moment, and then called
out:</p>

<p>"Hello, is that you, Willie Flint?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, good evening, Mrs. Stout," replied
Will, whom it proved to be, as he turned and
retraced his steps.</p>

<p>"I thought I knew your walk," said Mrs.
Stout. "Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"How's your mother?"</p>

<p>"Nicely, but I must be going, good&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you be in such a hurry, Willie Flint,"
Mrs. Stout interrupted, and then added, "This
is Miss Wallace here, and I guess you'd better
beau her home; it's a pretty dark night for young
women to be runnin' 'round alone."</p>

<p>Barbara almost hated Mrs. Stout for saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that. She had remained silent because, for one
reason, there had been no chance for her to speak,
and another reason was that she hoped&mdash;she
did and she did not&mdash;that Will would not follow
Mrs. Stout's suggestion. Barbara was not unlike
other young women in many ways.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Flint," she said, determined
to make the best of it whatever the outcome might
be.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> that you, Bar&mdash;Miss Wallace?" said
Will as he came into the yard and up the walk
to the steps. Mrs. Stout noticed that he had
started to say Barbara.</p>

<p>"I'll 'tend to those boys, Miss Wallace. Good
night," she said abruptly, and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Good night," replied Barbara and Will, as
they turned and went down the walk together.</p>

<p>"Who was it, ma?" the boys asked in chorus
when Mrs. Stout returned to the dining-room, but
their mother ignored them.</p>

<p>"Peter Stout," she began in a tone that made
him jump, "Henry didn't go to school this
afternoon, and Paul and Wendell told Miss Wallace
that he was sick."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Peter, turning on his
three sons, who sat trembling before him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, she came to see if Henry was any better,
and that let the cat out of the bag. They've got
to be 'tended to," replied Mrs. Stout. "Tended
to" in the Stout family meant something painful.
The boys looked at each other in dismay, and then
at their parents.</p>

<p>"I ain't got time now," said Peter, "but in
the mornin'&mdash;" With that terrible, unspoken
threat on his lips Peter put on his hat, and went
back to the store. Mrs. Stout began clearing the
table, and the boys silently filed out of the house
and sat down on the front door-steps to talk it
over.</p>

<p>"You've got to give me back that five cents I
give you for sayin' I was sick, Paul," said Henry,
"and you too, Wendell."</p>

<p>"I guess not," replied Paul and Wendell,
quickly.</p>

<p>"I got found out, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"We said you was sick, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to get a lickin', ain't I?"</p>

<p>"We're goin' to get one, too, ain't we?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't lie for money."</p>

<p>"No; you'd get somebody to lie for you," said
Wendell, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yer little brothers," added Paul.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't steal, anyway," retorted Henry.
For a moment they were silent.</p>

<p>"Hello, fellers," yelled a boy from the street.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom," replied the trio.</p>

<p>"Don't make any noise," cautioned Henry as
Tommy Tweedie came up to the steps.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked as he sat down.</p>

<p>"I got caught," said Henry.</p>

<p>Tommy whistled his surprise.</p>

<p>"Did the kids (meaning Paul and Wendell)
tell?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nope; Miss Wallace come to see how sick I
was."</p>

<p>"What'd your father say?" snickered Tom.</p>

<p>"Said he'd see us in the mornin'. Say, Tom,
what's this club for that your ma and mine are
gettin' up?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," replied Tommy, "only I heard
pop say we was goin' to have a tablet, kind of a
tombstone, you know, in the yard that told on it
when the club was foundered or somethin' like
that; and this mornin' he told Dora that he wished
the tablet was goin' to be put up right away with
the date the club died on it, too."</p>

<p>"Are they goin' to play ball?" asked Wendell.</p>

<p>"Women don't play ball," said Paul.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mother says," replied Tom, "that women
do everything nowadays."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Mrs. Stout, sternly, from the
doorway.</p>

<p>The three guilty ones filed solemnly into the
house, and Tommy Tweedie slipped away into
the darkness.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Barbara and Will</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Good</span> luck is with me sometimes, Barbara,"
said Will, as they turned into the street from Mrs.
Stout's yard.</p>

<p>"Is that a new name for me?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"No; but it would be a good one. I meant that
I was fortunate in meeting you; chance meetings,
you know, are often best."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Barbara, and then added, "if
the chance is genuine." He had met her so often
of late by chance, that now, as he was bold enough
to speak of it, for a moment she doubted his sincerity.</p>

<p>"Really, Barbara," he replied, quickly, "on
honour, I was on my way home, and had no idea
where you were." (Except, he might have added,
that she was first in his thoughts.) Barbara believed
him, nevertheless she was annoyed. Whether
her feeling of annoyance was caused by what Mrs.
Stout had said, by the chance meeting with Will, or
by what people were saying about them, Barbara
herself was not sure. She was certain, however,
that people were talking and linking her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with his in a way that she did not like. That very
night at supper Mrs. Tweedie had given her estimate
of Will Flint's character. The picture
that she painted, though more suggestive than
real, was intended to be anything except favourable,
and Barbara knew that it was intended
especially for her. But despite the talk, she liked
Will better than any other of her acquaintances in
Manville, because he at least was companionable
and honest.</p>

<p>"What's going on at the Stouts'?" asked Will.
Barbara related the story, and when she had
finished Will expressed his feelings with a long
whistle.</p>

<p>"The little rascals!" he exclaimed. "I suppose
it's all my fault."</p>

<p>"Your fault?" said Barbara, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. Early this afternoon as I was on my
way to the pond for an afternoon's fishing I met
the Stout boys. Henry asked me where I was
going, and when I told him he expressed a wish
that he might go too. I said come along, and he
did, after a whispered conference with the other
two. We had a bully time."</p>

<p>"You great big boy!" exclaimed Barbara,
not knowing whether to laugh or be angry. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
those three boys are going to be punished when
you are the one wholly to blame."</p>

<p>"But, Barbara, I never once thought about
school, and Henry didn't speak of it."</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't, but now he has got to
pay for his fun, and yours, too."</p>

<p>Will stopped and looked back, undecided as to
what he ought to do, and very much disturbed to
think that he had been the cause of trouble.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, go back and tell Mrs. Stout?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"It is all over now, probably."</p>

<p>"That's so," said Will, gloomily, as they resumed
their walk. "But I'll go down in the morning
and confess everything, and then, some day
when there's no school, I'll give those boys a
good time to pay for the whipping they've had.
The little villains&mdash;do you go to see them all
when they're sick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless some one comes to tell me about
them."</p>

<p>That was news to Will. He had thought always
that common school teachers' duties consisted
of hearing children recite, and the maintaining of
discipline in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," he said, in surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"that you think something of, or rather like,
every one of those dirty little kids?"</p>

<p>"Like them!" replied Barbara, warmly; "I
love them. How could I teach if I did not?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know, I never thought about it
before," he stammered. He had learned something.
He had heard her speak the word "love"
with feeling, and by it he knew the destiny that
he had hoped for, and was humbled. They had
reached Mrs. Tweedie's gate and stopped.</p>

<p>"Barbara," said Will, "you don't mind if I
walk home with you from the school sometimes,
do you?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied, after a pause. "I am glad
to have you&mdash;sometimes."</p>

<p>"And the other times, Barbara?" he asked,
and then quickly added, "Pardon me, I have no
right to ask; but I may come if not too often?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Barbara, and then went quickly
up the walk to the door.</p>

<p>"Good night," Will called after her, and then
slowly walked toward home filled with thoughts
of higher ideals, of Barbara, and his new love&mdash;for
her. What were her thoughts of him? he
wondered. Did she ever think of him at all? He
knew something of what others were thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and saying, but Barbara&mdash; He knew that many
believed that while away from home he had led a
dissolute life, and that he had been expelled from
college because of some dishonourable act. Barbara
surely had heard these stories about him&mdash;they
were all lies&mdash;but how was she to know?
Until then he had not cared what people said, but
now&mdash; Was he worthy even to try to win her?
Thus far in his life he had accomplished nothing.
What had he to offer her&mdash;not in money or position&mdash;but
as a man?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Classics and Women</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> committee on plays was in session at the
home of Mrs. Doctor Jones. During the first
fifteen minutes of the meeting its members had
annihilated the works of the poets and dramatists
up to the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"We really ought to give something from
Shakespeare," Mrs. Tweedie was saying.</p>

<p>"What do folks in Manville know about him?"
asked Mrs. Stout. "I say we ought to give somethin'
they can understand."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Stout," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
"that is just the reason why we ought to give
something from his works. The people of Manville
ought to know something of one of the world's
greatest poets. If they do not, it is clearly
the duty of the Morning Glory Club to assist in their enlightenment."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we can get 'em to come once,"
retorted Mrs. Stout, "but you can be sure they
won't get caught a second time. I think that
Shakespeare's too high-toned for folks 'round
here, but go ahead if you want to, I've had my
say." Mrs. Stout always had her say, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the ladies, particularly Mrs. Tweedie, wished
that she did not have it quite so often.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Miss Sawyer, "we could not
dream of attempting the production of the whole
of one of Shakespeare's plays, but there are many
beautiful scenes that we could undertake and be
reasonably sure of success."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea; why not give several
scenes instead of one play?" suggested Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Fanny Tweedie. "Then
we could all have star parts."</p>

<p>"Fanny," rebuked Mrs. Tweedie, "our personal
ambition must not be considered, and I
sincerely hope that a spirit of self-sacrifice will be
manifested, if necessary, when we come to the
assignment of parts. Your idea, Mrs. Jones, is to
give scenes from different plays?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Jones replied; "then if one or
more of the scenes were unsuccessful, we could
redeem ourselves with the others."</p>

<p>"True," said Mrs. Tweedie, wisely, and then
turning to Miss Sawyer, asked: "What scenes
would you suggest?"</p>

<p>As Miss Sawyer was considered the best read
woman in Manville, she was always the first to
be appealed to for advice in regard to such matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
though her shyness&mdash;often mistaken for modesty&mdash;made
her opinion difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>"During the past week," she began, "I have
been looking over my Shakespeare (Mrs. Tweedie's
suggestion) and have found several scenes that
we might consider. I would suggest first the trial
scene from the 'Merchant of Venice,' and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would be great!" interrupted Fanny
Tweedie. "Mrs. Stout could be the judge&mdash;I'd
like to play Portia myself&mdash;and ma would be
a lovely Shylock."</p>

<p>"Fanny," said Mrs. Tweedie, severely, "there
are others to be consulted in this matter." She
was provoked, not so much by Fanny's suggestion,
as by the titter it caused.</p>

<p>"Why, ma," Fanny continued, "you know
that we talked it over at home, and&mdash;" a warning
glance from her mother told Fanny that she had
said too much, and she suddenly subsided. At a
word from Mrs. Tweedie, Miss Sawyer continued:</p>

<p>"There is the balcony scene from 'Romeo
and Juliet,' and in 'As You Like It' there are
many beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones, "let's give the
scene in the forest where Rosalind, or somebody,
hangs valentines on the bushes&mdash;it's lovely."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very beautiful," murmured Miss Sawyer.
"And in the 'Merry Wives of Windsor' there
are many amusing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't know that Shakespeare was funny,"
blurted Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Not funny," corrected Mrs. Tweedie, "amusing;
his wit is of the keenest."</p>

<p>"Same thing, ain't it?" said Mrs. Stout.
"Ain't there a play about the taming of somebody?"</p>

<p>"The 'Taming of the Shrew,'" Miss Sawyer
responded, quickly.</p>

<p>"That's it. Why wouldn't that be a good
play for us?" laughed Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"I don't like the name," Mrs. Tweedie replied.
"It savours too much of the domineering of the
<i>other sex</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Stout, "we might change the
name."</p>

<p>"Change the name!" exclaimed the horrified
ladies.</p>

<p>"Change the name of one of Shakespeare's
plays!" groaned Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"What name, may I ask," said Mrs. Tweedie,
majestically, "would you substitute?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout was thoroughly enjoying the discomfiture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that she had caused, and was laughing
in a most provoking manner.</p>

<p>"We might call it the 'Un-taming of the
Shrews,'" she replied, and then added: "See
here, I don't see any terrible harm in changin' the
name of anything. You changed yours, Mis'
Tweedie, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No," snapped Mrs. Tweedie, "I added a
name to the one I already had." Mrs. Tweedie
always wrote her name Aurelia Scraggs Tweedie.
(Scraggs was a famous actor&mdash;three times removed&mdash;the
moves, hasty ones, being from
Providence Plantation to Boston, from Boston to
Salem, and from there to Portsmouth, with the
king's officers close upon his heels at every step.)</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse <i>me</i>," said Mrs. Stout, with exaggerated
politeness, "but the rest of us did
change our names when we was married."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout," replied Mrs. Tweedie, as she
glared at the promoter of the disturbance, "the
business before us is not of a humourous nature."</p>

<p>"Good land!" retorted Mrs. Stout. "If we've
got to wear funeral faces every time we get together
we'd better bust up now."</p>

<p>"Humour and wit," said Mrs. Tweedie, icily,
"have their place, but the changing of the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of a classic would be sacrilege." For the time being
Mrs. Stout had had enough fun, and permitted
Mrs. Tweedie to have the last word.</p>

<p>"Has any one thought of the old comedies, so-called,
of Sheridan and Goldsmith?" asked Mrs.
Jones. "There's 'She Stoops to Conquer,'
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would never do," said Mrs. Stout, breaking
forth again; "we wouldn't 'stoop to conquer,'
not even for a classic," and for once Mrs. Tweedie
agreed with her.</p>

<p>"The title certainly is not appropriate for a
woman's club," she remarked, decidedly.</p>

<p>"The 'School for Scandal' is a famous play,"
Miss Sawyer ventured to suggest, but the only
approval her suggestion received was another
outburst of laughter from Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"If we should give that play," she gurgled,
"we'd be sure to make a hit, it would be so
natural."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the future welfare of the Morning
Glory Club the telephone bell rang at that
moment, and Mrs. Jones hastened to answer its
summons.</p>

<p>The telephone was in the hall, only a step or
two from the room in which the ladies were sitting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and as Mrs. Jones went out she left the door ajar.
Silence fell over the group&mdash;not because that
they wished to hear, of course, but in order that
Mrs. Jones might not be annoyed. A message
to a doctor's home might be <i>so</i> important, you
know.</p>

<p>"Diphtheria?" they heard her say. "Where?&mdash;At
school&mdash;The Clark children?&mdash;What?&mdash;Oh,
Miss who?&mdash;Miss Wallace?&mdash;Sent the
children home?&mdash;Yes.&mdash;Will you be home to
lunch?&mdash;What?&mdash;Will there be any?&mdash;<i>Of
course</i>&mdash;Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Diphtheria!" exclaimed the ladies when
they were sure that Mrs. Jones was through, and
a look of anxiety spread over the faces of those
who had children.</p>

<p>"Did you hear?" asked Mrs. Jones, as she
re&euml;ntered the room. "Miss Wallace suspected
that one of the Clark girls had diphtheria, so she
sent both of them home. The doctor is at the
Clarks' now, and says that Miss Wallace was
right, and that the school will have to be closed."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, "just
think of havin' them three boys of mine runnin'
wild for three or four weeks, to say nothin' of the
danger of their bein' sick."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"What we have heard is very distressing,"
said Mrs. Tweedie, "but let us not be unnerved
until we learn all of the particulars. In the
meantime would it not be wise to continue with our
work? Miss Sawyer, are you familiar with
Ibsen's plays?" Thus did Mrs. Tweedie throw
off diphtheria for Ibsen.</p>

<p>"I have read 'A Doll's House,'" replied Miss
Sawyer, blushing.</p>

<p>"'A Doll's House,'" queried Mrs. Stout, "is it
a play for children?"</p>

<p>"By no means," snapped Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma!" Fanny exclaimed, "I don't know
anything about Ibsen, but do you remember
'The Lady of Lyons?' We saw it in Boston.
It was about the loveliest girl&mdash;a princess&mdash;who
married a labourer's son disguised as a prince,
and when she found it out he went into the army,
and then came home as a general or something,
and they made up."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember," replied Mrs. Tweedie.
"Let me see, who wrote it?"</p>

<p>"Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer," said Miss Sawyer,
promptly. "It's a beautiful play containing some
of the sweetest love-scenes imaginable."</p>

<p>"Has it got anything to do with a circus?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
asked Mrs. Stout, innocently, having in mind, no
doubt, the lady in a cage of lions with the "Ding-a-ling
Circus," that came to Manville every year.</p>

<p>"Circus, indeed not!" said Mrs. Jones.
"Lyons is the name of a city in France."</p>

<p>"Oh," was all that Mrs. Stout had to say in
reply. She was gaining knowledge rapidly, and
realized it. Only the night before she had said
to her husband that "if the club don't go up
I expect to know somethin' sometime."</p>

<p>Formal suggestions and discussion gave way to
general chatting. They were not getting ahead
at all, and Mrs. Tweedie became annoyed. As
she sat watching them, a new and alarming thought
came suddenly into her mind, and a look of
consternation spread over her face.</p>

<p>"Ladies!" she exclaimed, in a choking voice,
"it has just occurred to me that in every play that
has been suggested there are MALE CHARACTERS!"
The silence that followed Mrs. Tweedie's
statement was cruelly disheartening.
What a horrible thought, such a dejected-looking
gathering of women was never seen before.</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" gasped Mrs. Jones, who was
the first to recover from the shock. "Is it possible
that in every classic there is a man?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Men wrote most of 'em, didn't they?" asked
Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie's eyes snapped angrily.</p>

<p>"That is not a fair question," she said. "What
if they did write the classics? Doubtless you can
guess why."</p>

<p>"Most prob'ly," replied Mrs. Stout, in a tone
that was meek for her, "it was because the women
folks had to spend their time washin' dishes and
'tendin' babies, and didn't have time even to try."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> there a Mis' Shakespeare?" queried
Mrs. Stout. No one seemed to know.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Jones, "if we can't find a
play without a man in it, what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Play the part of men ourselves," replied
Fanny Tweedie, boldly.</p>

<p>"Fanny!" exclaimed her mother.</p>

<p>"A good idea," said Mrs. Stout. "I guess
that most of us women know enough about men
to make believe."</p>

<p>"That's so," added Mrs. Jones, "such things
have been done, I don't see what harm it would
do."</p>

<p>"But the costuming," said Mrs. Tweedie,
"how would that be arranged?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put a sign, 'this is a man,' on the ones that
have men's parts," suggested Mrs. Stout. A
ring at the door quickly stopped the titter caused
by Mrs. Stout's suggestion. Mrs. Jones excused
herself and left the room. Again perfect silence
reigned.</p>

<p>"Mother wants the doctor right off," they
heard a boy say. "The baby's broke out all
over."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him just as soon as he returns,"
replied Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Measles," said Mrs. Stout in a loud whisper,
"what a time we are havin'."</p>

<p>"It was Sammy Dobbins," explained Mrs.
Jones, when she returned. "That's the way I
have to run all day; first the telephone, and then
the door-bell."</p>

<p>"It must be very trying," said Mrs. Tweedie,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Here it is, here it is!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout,
explosively, as she waved a book that she had
taken from a table a moment before. "Listen:
'Vanity Fair, a Novel without a Hero,'" she read.
"Ain't there a play by that name?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," sniffed Mrs. Tweedie. "It's
full of men, and such men&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a woman," added Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Such a woman," said Miss Sawyer. Mrs.
Stout closed the book, and replaced it. She was
squelched.</p>

<p>"We are getting on very slowly," sighed Mrs.
Tweedie. "Let me suggest a programme." No
one objected. "What would you say to the trial
scene from the 'Merchant of Venice,' the balcony
scene from 'Romeo and Juliet,' a scene from the
'Lady of Lyons,' and a one-act play written by
our Miss Sawyer, entitled 'Yellow Roses'?"</p>

<p>There was much to be said, and the discussion
began anew, but Mrs. Tweedie was determined
to win, and win she did.</p>

<p>"The smell of medicine in a doctor's house,"
remarked Mrs. Stout, as she walked toward home
with Mrs. Thornton, "always makes me feel as
though my last day had come."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Woman's Way</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barbara Wallace</span> never forgot the morning on
which she discovered that one of her pupils was
threatened with diphtheria. The child affected,
and her sister, were sent home, and Tommy
Tweedie was sent for Mr. George, the chairman
of the school committee. While awaiting his
arrival, Barbara went on with the morning's work,
but with less interest than usual, and a heavy
heart.</p>

<p>An hour and a half dragged by before Mr.
George came. On the way he had met Doctor
Jones, who had seen the sick child, and confirmed
Barbara's suspicions. That morning he had
discovered three cases himself. Conditions were
considered serious, and Mr. George decided that
the school should be closed for at least two weeks,
and instructed Barbara to inform the children
before they were dismissed at noon. When she
made the announcement, the thoughtless young
Americans wiggled like tadpoles at the prospect
of a two weeks' vacation, and danced and shouted
for joy the moment they were out-of-doors. Barbara
watched them from the doorway as they ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
off, and when the thought came to her that some
of them might never return, the tears sprang to
her eyes. When the children had disappeared she
went back to her desk, for a moment looked over
the shabby little room and the rows of empty seats,
then buried her head in her arms and sobbed like
a child.</p>

<p>"Miss Wallace," she heard some one say in a
child's sweet voice.</p>

<p>Barbara looked up and saw Bessie Duncan, one
of her flock, standing in the doorway with a bunch
of autumn leaves in her hand. Bessie belonged
to one of the poorest, dirtiest families in Manville;
she herself, however, was a diamond, though a
dirty one, and Barbara loved her.</p>

<p>"Why, Bessie," said Barbara, wiping her eyes,
"did you forget something?"</p>

<p>"No, um, I&mdash;why ain't we goin' to have school
any more?"</p>

<p>"Because some of the children are sick, and we
don't want any of the others to be."</p>

<p>"Ain't we ever goin' to have any more school?"
Bessie asked, as she walked slowly toward Barbara.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, when the children are well again."</p>

<p>The child was silent for a moment, then she
smiled, and gave Barbara the bunch of leaves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"There ain't any flowers now," she said, "so
I got these for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Bessie, you were very kind to
think of me. Aren't they pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, um, I picked 'em all by myself in the
woods. What makes the leaves fall off?"</p>

<p>"Because winter is coming."</p>

<p>"Miss Wallace," said the child after a pause,
"I hope you ain't goin' to be sick and die."</p>

<p>Barbara took the little one in her arms, and
kissed her dirty little cheek.</p>

<p>"No, Bessie, I hope not."</p>

<p>"I like you, Miss Wallace."</p>

<p>"I am very glad that you do."</p>

<p>"Does that big man like you, too?" Bessie
innocently asked, and then wondered why her
teacher's face grew pink. Before Barbara had
time to reply she heard a heavy step, and looking
up saw Will Flint, the "big man," standing in the
doorway and smiling at what he thought was a
pretty picture.</p>

<p>"Don't come in," said Barbara, in alarm.</p>

<p>"Why, Barbara, what&mdash;" he began as he
walked toward her.</p>

<p>"Don't, please&mdash;Will," pleaded Barbara.
"Please go outside, and then I will explain."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Will backed slowly out of the door, wondering
what had happened to cause Barbara to speak
and act so strangely. When he had closed the
door Barbara put Bessie down, and went to an
open window. Will felt relieved when he looked
up and saw her smiling.</p>

<p>"We discovered diphtheria among the children
to-day, and I didn't want you to be exposed,"
she explained.</p>

<p>"How about yourself?" he asked, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Why, I have got to take my chances with the
children."</p>

<p>"Rather dangerous, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I suppose so; the school is to be closed
for two weeks."</p>

<p>Will did not like that, he would miss the walks
that he had been enjoying with her.</p>

<p>"Are you going home soon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must not go with me to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," said Will, quickly.</p>

<p>"But I am&mdash;for you," she replied. The
tiniest bit of hesitation before the "for you"
made Will happy, but he made no reply. Perhaps
it was the time, or place, or the big blue eyes of
Bessie Duncan peering at him over the window-sill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that restrained him from speaking the words
that trembled on his lips.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," was all he said, as he turned
quickly and strode away. In place of the sun and
sky, the woods and fields, he saw her face. He
did not hear the chatter of the crows, or the
soughing of the wind; only her voice could he
hear saying, "Will," and "for you."</p>

<p>Barbara and Bessie watched until he disappeared
around a bend in the road.</p>

<p>"Is he a good man?" Bessie asked as she took
Barbara's hand, and looked up at her earnestly.
It was she who had asked that same question
before. The first time Barbara had evaded an
answer, but now she replied quickly, and with a
flood of meaning:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Men Talk Too</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Stout's Grocery</span>," as the sign over the door
read, was the scene&mdash;especially on rainy evenings&mdash;of
many heated debates and windy harangues
on topics as varied as New England weather.
There was decided the policies of the great
political parties; the characters of great or notorious
men were weighed and analyzed; the worth,
financial, mental, and moral, of the citizens of
Manville&mdash;not present&mdash;were frankly estimated;
and, alas, sometimes, the virtues and vices of
women received the attention of the gathering of
do-little busybodies.</p>

<p>It was raining. The prophecy had appeared
in the evening paper, and it had come to pass
that the prophecy and the elements were working
harmoniously. Only a few brief words were devoted
to it by those who had gathered at the
store on this particular evening. Incense, in
kind, was ascending in clouds to one of man's
greatest gods&mdash;tobacco.</p>

<p>"How's that woman's club gettin' 'long?"
Sam Billings asked without addressing any one
in particular.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hear," replied Mr. Blake, the undertaker,
"that they're doing first-rate. My wife has
joined."</p>

<p>"You 'n' your wife are gettin' to be reg'lar
jiners, ain't yer? B'long to 'most everything
now," remarked Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, we like to keep in touch with what's
going on in the world," replied Mr. Blake, modestly.</p>

<p>"Business is business," chuckled Sam. Mr.
Blake made no reply to the insinuation. "What
do they want a club for, anyway?" Sam continued.
"Don't they have enough to do without gettin'
together and stirrin' things up?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's because they want a change,"
suggested Alick Purbeck.</p>

<p>"Change?" sniffed Sam, scornfully. "What
change do any of us get? We get up in the morning
every day at the same time, eat our breakfast, go
to work, eat our dinner, go to work, eat our
supper, and&mdash;sometimes we come down here
and swap lies, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's your change," interrupted Mr. Blake.
"At our work most of us men meet different
people, we see new faces and new things, but the
women stay at home, wash, sew, cook, care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the children, and never know when the day is
done unless they look at the clock&mdash;then they're
not always sure."</p>

<p>"There ain't any use tryin' to argue with you,"
replied Sam. "What are they goin' to do at this
club that'll give 'em a change?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Blake, "I understand that
they're going to give a play, study art, science, and
so forth, and give social affairs that will bring
the people together in a way that will benefit us
all."</p>

<p>"Ump! I'd like to know how they'll do <i>me</i>
any good," grunted Sam.</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Mr. Blake, "I can't think of
anything at this moment that they could do to
make you any better or worse, but when women
set out to do anything I've noticed that they
generally get there."</p>

<p>"You're right about that," said Sam, wagging
his head, "they are persistent critters."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you were married you'd have more
respect for women," added Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"Maybe his weddin' ain't so very far off,"
said Alick Purbeck. "I've seen him in comp'ny
with the same lady three times within a week."</p>

<p>"Jest happened so," retorted Sam.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gettin' married jest happens sometimes,"
replied Alick.</p>

<p>"When a woman ketches me," said Sam,
boastfully, "she's got to be mighty fetchin' in
more ways 'n one."</p>

<p>"If there's any catching to be done, I guess
you'll have to do it," commented Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>Sam felt that he was getting the worst of the
argument, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>"What kind of a show are they goin' to give?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Scenes from the classics," replied Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"Is it a good play?" Sam innocently inquired.
Mr. Blake began to explain, but before he had
finished the door was opened and Ezra Tweedie
came in.</p>

<p>"Evenin', Ezra," said Peter Stout, from his
seat on the counter.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," replied Ezra, with
a queer little nod, and then giving Peter a slip of
paper, added, "Kindly put up those things for
me, Mr. Stout."</p>

<p>"Certain," said Peter, as he slid off the counter.</p>

<p>While waiting for his order to be put up, Ezra
sat down with the group of tobacco slaves. Ezra
did not smoke himself, his health would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
permit it, so he said, but everybody knew that
the disapproval of Aurelia Scraggs Tweedie was
all that kept him from the use of the seductive
narcotic. He liked <i>to be smoked</i>, however, and
was always delighted when his wife sent him to
the store in the evening. And the men, the smokers,
liked Ezra&mdash;and pitied him.</p>

<p>"How's things with you, Ezra?" asked Sam
when Ezra was comfortably seated.</p>

<p>"About the same, thank you," Ezra cheerfully
replied.</p>

<p>"Here's the man," Sam went on, "that can
tell us all about the woman's club, can't you,
Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Well," Ezra began, with a cough and a smile,
"I cannot say that I know all about it, but naturally
I do know something, perhaps a little more
than any other of <i>our sex</i>." "<i>Our sex</i>" was the
offspring of his wife's favourite term, the "<i>other
sex</i>." Ezra was so seldom the centre of interest,
or the source of information, that the position
which he held at that moment pleased him immensely.</p>

<p>"Your wife has been chosen president, I believe,"
said Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ezra, proudly, "and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the one who conceived the idea, the founder, one
could justly say."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Sam.</p>

<p>Ezra smiled a broader smile as he looked at the
interested, open-mouthed men about him. Very
likely he thought that the next best thing to being
a man himself was to have a manly wife.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" Ezra asked, turning
toward Peter, who had spoken from the depths of
a sugar-barrel.</p>

<p>"Green tea, or black?" said Peter as he withdrew
his head and shoulders from the barrel, his
face very red.</p>

<p>"Oh, green and black mixed, please," replied
Ezra, and then picking up the thread of the conversation
where he had dropped it continued:
"Yes, Mrs. Tweedie founded the club, and is
now its president. I feel confident that it is
going to be a grand thing for our town."</p>

<p>"How's that?" Sam asked, hoping to "set
Ezra a-goin'," as he would have expressed it.</p>

<p>"How?" repeated Ezra. "By lifting us out
of the mire of ignorance, by encouraging social
intercourse, in fact, by broadening us in every
way."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" exclaimed Sam.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do mean it." Ezra did mean it at
the time he spoke, notwithstanding sentiments
that he had previously expressed to the contrary.</p>

<p>"What'd I tell you, Sam?" said Alick, vauntingly,
and turning to Ezra, added: "Sam, here,
Mr. Tweedie, has been runnin' women folks
down, and we told him it was because he wasn't
married."</p>

<p>"And you were right, Alick; a man who is
unmarried is not competent to judge women,"
Ezra replied.</p>

<p>"And a man that <i>is</i> married don't dare to,"
retorted Sam.</p>

<p>The entrance of Doctor Jones at that moment
saved Sam from a severe tongue-lashing from the
married men present.</p>

<p>The doctor was a jolly, generous soul who did
twice as much work as he was paid for, and was
loved and hated after the manner of all general
practitioners of medicine. There were people
in Manville who declared that Doctor Jones
could work miracles, while others said that he
was a butcher and a murderer; but men who
have the courage to fight disease and death are
not often disturbed or injured by the wagging
of mischievous tongues.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor, as he sat down, "who
is catching it to-night?"</p>

<p>"The woman's club," Sam promptly replied.</p>

<p>"The town is more stirred up over that club
than it ever was about anything before," laughed
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Now, seein' we've got the question before
us," said Sam, "s'pose you give us your
opinion."</p>

<p>"Oh, the club is all right, I guess," replied the
doctor.</p>

<p>"There, Sam," said Alick, "I guess you're
the only woman-hater in the crowd."</p>

<p>"I ain't no woman-hater," replied Sam, indignantly.</p>

<p>"No," Alick laughed, "but you try to make us
think you are."</p>

<p>"No such thing; all I want to know is, what's
this woman's club for, and how's it goin' to help
Manville?"</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Alick, "it's <i>for</i> the women,
and it's goin' to help Manville by showin' <i>you</i>
what an ignorant cuss <i>you</i> be."</p>

<p>Sam threw a potato at his tormentor, but Alick
dodged, and the missile knocked off Ezra Tweedie's
hat.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"No offence, Mr. Tweedie," said Alick, quickly,
"strictly unintentional."</p>

<p>"No harm, no harm," replied Ezra, as he got
up and put on his hat; "but I guess it is time for
me to go if my things are ready, Mr. Stout."</p>

<p>Peter handed Ezra his basket, and then whispered
something in his ear. "Certainly, certainly,"
said Ezra, "it shall be attended to the
first of the week." And then turning to the others
wished them, "Good evening, gentlemen," walked
quickly to the door, and went out.</p>

<p>"Ain't he the queerest little man you ever see?"
observed Sam, when Ezra had gone.</p>

<p>"Queer!" replied Alick, "he ain't any queerer
in his way than you are in yours."</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno; he's a little too womanish to
suit me," said Sam.</p>

<p>"If you had a streak of it in you perhaps you'd
show off better." Just then the door was opened,
and Barbara Wallace came in and started toward
the group of men, hesitated for a moment, and
then stopped. The men took the pipes from their
mouths and stared at the woman in dripping
garments. She was evidently in great distress
and looking for some one, but the tobacco smoke
was so thick, and the light so dim, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
difficult for her to distinguish the faces of the men
present. Doctor Jones got up and went toward
her.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for some one, Miss Wallace?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, I wanted you, and I hoped"&mdash;her
voice trembled&mdash;"I hoped to find Mr. Blake
here, too." When the undertaker heard his name
he joined them.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asked the doctor, anxiously.
He had thought that his patients were in no
danger, at least for the night. Tears came to
Barbara's eyes.</p>

<p>"Bessie Duncan," she replied.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that she is&mdash;" the doctor hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you'll go, doctor, and you, too, won't
you, Mr. Blake?" Barbara pleaded. The expression
on the undertaker's face was not encouraging.
"I know about the others," she continued,
"but they have had such a hard time,
please go&mdash;for me, Mr. Blake. I'll&mdash;I&mdash;you
can come to me for the money."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Mr. Blake; "never mind about
the money."</p>

<p>"Come," was all that Barbara said as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
started for the door followed by the two men.
The three went out into the rain and the darkness
of the night on their cheerless errand.</p>

<p>The talkers at the store were silent for a long
time after that. They had heard all that was
said, though it was far from Barbara's intention
that they should, but she had been so eager to
secure the assistance of the doctor and Mr. Blake
that she had thought only of them.</p>

<p>"So Miss Wallace wants to pay the bills of that
mean, drunken skunk of a Rufe Duncan," said
Sam, fiercely.</p>

<p>"That ain't any of your business," retorted
Alick. "If she wants to have the little girl buried
decent, what's the harm?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't her place," replied Sam, more for the
sake of an argument than because he believed it.
"What do you say, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I say," Peter began, slowly, "I've heard about
angels with wings, but the only kind I've ever
seen is just such little women as Miss Wallace is."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Rehearsal</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Scene i</span>, Act IV., of the "Merchant of Venice"
was on for rehearsal and mutilation at the home
of Mrs. Tweedie by a cast whose performance
assured a treat for the people of Manville.</p>

<p>Early that morning Mrs. Tweedie, having in
mind the domestic friction which had been displayed
at the first meeting of the club, and desiring
to prevent the possibility of its recurrence,
had sent her husband on a long errand, given
Dora permission to visit a cousin, and urged
Tommy to spend the day in the woods.</p>

<p>When the hour appointed for the rehearsal
came, Miss Sawyer&mdash;at a previous meeting appointed
stage-directress&mdash;was bustling about
arranging chairs and table in an effort to make
Mrs. Tweedie's parlour resemble a court of justice
in Venice. When she had completed her work,
the room looked as though house-cleaning was in
progress. While this was being done, the ladies
who had parts in the scene huddled in the front
hall, and chatted in subdued tones. Anticipatory
fear was already hovering over them.</p>

<p>"I am ready, ladies," announced Miss Sawyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The hearts of the amateur actresses beat faster
as they entered the parlour and gazed upon the
arrangement of the furniture.</p>

<p>"That," Miss Sawyer began to explain as she
pointed to a large chair flanked on each side by
two smaller ones, "is where the Duke and Magnificoes
sit, and these chairs and tables down here
and those on either side are to be used by the other
characters." If the scene was set and played as
arranged by Miss Sawyer it would resemble a
minstrel circle with the Duke as interlocutor, and
Shylock and Antonio for "bones" and "tambo."</p>

<p>"Where do we come in?" asked Mrs. Jones,
timidly.</p>

<p>"When you've got something to say," said
Mrs. Stout, before Miss Sawyer had time to
reply.</p>

<p>"We will only use one entrance," explained
Miss Sawyer, when the laugh that Mrs. Stout
caused had subsided. "It will be much easier
to remember, and accordingly will prevent confusion.
And that," she said, waving her hand
toward one side of the room, "is where the audience
is supposed to be. Now if the cast will
please step back into the hall we will begin."</p>

<p>The "cast" solemnly filed from the room, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Miss Sawyer, book in hand, took up a position in
the centre of the stage.</p>

<p>"'Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Antonio,
Bassanio, Gratiano, Salerio, and others,'" she
read.</p>

<p>"Who's goin' to be the 'others'?" called Mrs.
Stout. Miss Sawyer made no reply, and the rest
did not laugh because each of them, excepting
Mrs. Tweedie and Mrs. Stout, when the name
of the character she was to play was read, had a
nervous chill. Miss Sawyer waited patiently for
some one to enter, but no one stirred.</p>

<p>"Who goes in first?" asked Mrs. Blake.</p>

<p>"The Duke," replied Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout. "Have
I got to be the first one?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; come right in and act as naturally
as you can," said Miss Sawyer, with a patronizing
air of encouragement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout entered, followed by her "soot,"
as she called it, and stood staring at the open book
before her&mdash;dumb.</p>

<p>"Well?" Miss Sawyer looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Shall I say what I've got to now?" asked Mrs.
Stout.</p>

<p>"Yes, but face the audience first." Strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to relate, Mrs. Stout seemed to be confused. She
turned, but the wrong way. "No, no," Miss
Sawyer corrected, nervously, "this way."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Stout, as she faced in the
right direction and began to read.</p>

<p>"It's your turn, Mrs. Blake," prompted Miss
Sawyer, when Mrs. Stout had read her first line.
(One would have thought that they were playing
croquet.)</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Blake, all in a flutter,
"is it?" and then when she had found the place,
read, "'Ready, so please your grace.'"</p>

<p>And so the rehearsal of the famous scene hitched
along until the approach of Shylock was announced.
Mrs. Tweedie, who was to play the
part, was ready, and entered at precisely the right
moment with her accustomed assurance. And
when Mrs. Stout had waded and stumbled
through the long speech of the Duke to Shylock,
Mrs. Tweedie, scorning to look at her book, began
her lines. She had seen a famous actor play the
part, and tried to imitate him, but failed horribly.</p>

<p>Harmony prevailed until Mrs. Jones balked
at a word in the text that a lady of the Morning
Glory Club would not use&mdash;outside of her family
circle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot, will not, use such a word!" she
exclaimed, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mrs. Jones," entreated Mrs.
Tweedie, "this is the work of Shakespeare, a
classic."</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted Mrs. Stout, who had discovered
the word in question. "If such words
are all right here, then our men folks are quoting
the classics and the Bible most of the time."</p>

<p>"My dear ladies," interposed Miss Sawyer,
"you do not seem to understand the sense in
which the word is used; your view-point is incorrect."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Stout, "I know that when
my husband quotes the classics folks most always
<i>see</i> the point."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" interrupted Fanny Tweedie.
"Let's skip the naughty words; I'm just dying
to have this rehearsal over with."</p>

<p>"Fanny," reproved Mrs. Tweedie. "Do proceed,
Mrs. Jones, I am sure that as we go on we
will find a way out of the difficulty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones went on with her part, mouthing her
lines meaninglessly.</p>

<p>"'The quality of Mercy is not strain'd&mdash;'"
read Fanny Tweedie, in a strained voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Stout interrupted her by innocently observing:
"I wonder why Shakespeare used so
many old sayin's."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie and Miss Sawyer turned pale;
Fanny Tweedie giggled unreproved, and then
another of those painful silences prevailed.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout," said Mrs. Tweedie, when she
could control herself, "<i>we</i> have been quoting
Shakespeare for over three hundred years; <i>he</i>
never quoted anybody."</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout; then she
laughingly added: "Perhaps you and Miss
Sawyer have been quotin' him for three hundred
years, but I'm mighty sure that I ain't."</p>

<p>"When I said <i>we</i> I meant the world," replied
Mrs. Tweedie, haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Stout, and the incident was
closed.</p>

<p>"What an unfeeling wretch that Shylock was,"
observed Mrs. Blake, after the rehearsal had
continued without interruption for several minutes.
"It makes me shudder to think of such a
man. How are you going to dress for the part,
Mrs. Tweedie?"</p>

<p>"I shall endeavour to dress appropriately, and
as becomes my sex," replied Mrs. Tweedie.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ladies, let us not waste valuable time talking
dress," said Miss Sawyer, impatiently.</p>

<p>"What's the harm, I'd like to know; who's
got a better right to talk about dress than us
women?" asked Mrs. Stout, pertly.</p>

<p>"But is the subject appropriate at this time?"
retorted Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"It's always appropriate," replied Mrs. Stout.
"A woman can't be happy unless she's well
dressed, or thinks she is, any more'n a man can
be good-natured on an empty stomach."</p>

<p>"Which proves the inferiority of the <i>other sex</i>,"
said Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Ump! I don't know about that," replied
Mrs. Stout. "We make just as big fools of ourselves
about dressin' as the men do about eatin'
and drinkin'."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and is it not commendable to appear
as well as one can?" queried Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"That's all right," retorted Mrs. Stout, "if
it ended there, but it don't. Most women folks
would wear a smile, a pink ribbon, and rings
on their toes if the fashion papers said it was
proper, and then wonder why the men stared at
'em."</p>

<p>"Because some women err in such matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are we&mdash;" remonstrated Mrs. Jones, mildly, but
Fanny interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, in her explosive manner,
"I'm in the greatest luck! Miss Wallace is going
to let me take her graduation cap and gown. I've
tried them on and the effect is just killing."</p>

<p>"You are very fortunate, and how is Miss
Wallace?" asked Mrs. Blake.</p>

<p>"Tired out," replied Fanny, "running around
calling on sick children."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said Mrs. Darling, "that
Miss Wallace spent an evening at the store a few
days ago."</p>

<p>"There ain't a word of truth in it!" hotly replied
Mrs. Stout. "She went there just for a
minute to get Doctor Jones and Mr. Blake the
night little Bessie Duncan died. The way such
lies travel beats automobiles."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I didn't believe it for one moment,"
simpered Mrs. Darling, "and I wouldn't
say a word to injure her for worlds&mdash;she's such
a <i>lovely</i> girl."</p>

<p>"Girl," said Mrs. Thornton, "she's every day
of twenty-five."</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Mrs. Blake, "I wouldn't
have believed it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," drawled Mrs. Stout, "it's a long time
since any of us, 'ceptin' Fanny, was that age."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout will speak the truth at all times,"
remarked Mrs. Tweedie, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to tell it," retorted Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, ladies," said Miss Sawyer, "but
we have drifted away from the work of the great
poet."</p>

<p>"Poet!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout. "Was Shakespeare
a poet?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Miss Sawyer, impatiently.</p>

<p>"And is this play poetry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, much of it."</p>

<p>"Well!" Mrs. Stout's astonishment equalled
her ignorance.</p>

<p>"Do you object greatly to poetry?" asked
Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Mrs. Stout, "poetry is
good, like angel-cake, but you can't live on it."</p>

<p>The laugh that followed cleared the atmosphere,
and the rehearsal continued. As it progressed the
ladies gained courage, and declaimed their lines
in what they thought was a professional manner.
Miss Sawyer was pleased and beamed on them
encouragingly, suggesting now and then a gesture,
inflection, or "business," but, despite her efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to keep them constantly on the dramatic road,
digressions were frequent.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Miss Wallace cares anything about
Will Flint," said Mrs. Thornton to Mrs. Darling,
when they were alone in a corner of the hall waiting
their "turn."</p>

<p>"I am sure that <i>I</i> don't know, but I have heard
that he was very fond of her, and that he walks
to and from school with her almost every
day."</p>

<p>"Really! and hasn't he anything else to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. Of course you know
that there are mysterious, disagreeable stories
about him, and that for a minister's son he is&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly."</p>

<p>"'There's a skeleton&mdash;' you know the saying,
and&mdash;" Just then the gossipers heard the rustle
of skirts in the hall above, followed by the sound
of a door being closed. They looked at each other
in dismay.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose?" gasped Mrs. Darling, in
alarm.</p>

<p>"I'll find out," replied Mrs. Thornton, as she
went to the parlour door and beckoned to Fanny
Tweedie.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Fanny, as she
came into the hall.</p>

<p>"Sh! Is&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Wallace at home?"
whispered Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p>"Yes," Fanny replied. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the culprits.</p>

<p>"What <i>will</i> she think of us?" groaned Mrs.
Darling.</p>

<p>"What are you folks whisperin' about?" asked
Mrs. Stout at that moment as she came out into
the hall and joined them. Fanny laughed, she
had guessed the cause of Mrs. Darling's and Mrs.
Thornton's discomfiture, and enjoyed the situation.</p>

<p>"Well," whispered Mrs. Thornton in reply to
Mrs. Stout's question, "we, Dolly and I, were
talking out here, and we happened to mention&mdash;we
spoke of Will Flint and Miss Wallace, and we
think that perhaps she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heard," interrupted Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p>"Good 'nough for you," said Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Sh! But we didn't say a word that she could
object to," continued Mrs. Thornton.</p>

<p>"At least about her," added Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Stout, "you did say somethin'
about Willie Flint that&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed the guilty ones.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Mrs. Stout, lowering her
voice. "But let me tell you that I believe that
Willie Flint ain't half as bad as some folks try to
make him out to be, and as for he and Miss
Wallace&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is your turn, Mrs. Darling," called Miss
Sawyer from the parlour. The whisperers returned
to their work, but in the minds of two of them
were many misgivings.</p>

<p>"Serves her right," whispered Mrs. Darling
to Mrs. Thornton at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"Indeed it does," was her friend's reply.</p>

<p>The aspirants for histrionic laurels rehearsed
the scene twice, and then sat down to talk it over.</p>

<p>"What I can't understand," said Mrs. Blake,
"is why Bassanio and Gratiano didn't know
Portia and Nerissa, with whom they were in
love."</p>

<p>"Portia and Nerissa were dressed as men,"
replied Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"And supposed to be miles away," added Miss
Sawyer.</p>

is that most men know their best girls when they
see 'em, no matter what they've got on. Goodness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

<h2>Chapter XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Narrow Way</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. Flint</span>," said the Reverend Elijah one
morning when the family of three were at breakfast,
"during the past week I have heard frequently
of the contemplated theatrical performance
by the members, and for the benefit, of the
woman's club."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Flint, timidly, "everybody
seems to be looking forward to it with pleasure."</p>

<p>"That was not the point I was about to make,"
said the parson, curtly. "You, of course, know
that I disapprove of such pastimes."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, certainly, but it all was planned
without my approval," explained his wife.</p>

<p>"Naturally, if you considered the dignity demanded
of you as the wife of a clergyman." The
heavy, rounded shoulders of this conventional
clergyman were raised slightly, and his dull eyes
peered over his spectacles at the troubled face
of Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"But, Elijah&mdash;" she faltered.</p>

<p>"I have given the matter careful thought,"
interrupted the parson, "and have arrived at the
conclusion that this performance is uncalled for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
unbecoming, undignified, and unnecessary." Mr.
Flint never left the church&mdash;he was in the pulpit
always, and for ever preaching.</p>

<p>"Elijah!" gasped his wife.</p>

<p>The parson's alliterative denouncement amused
his son in the same degree that it caused his wife's
dismay, and it was with difficulty that Will controlled
his mirth.</p>

<p>"And furthermore," Mr. Flint continued, "it
is my desire that you sever your connection with
the organization immediately."</p>

<p>"But, Elijah, I am deeply interested in the
work, and we&mdash;we need the money&mdash;I mean the
club does," faltered Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"The evil one," said the parson, impressively,
"employs many means and uses countless disguises
for that unholy purpose."</p>

<p>"But surely you do not think that the principles
of our club are wrong?"</p>

<p>"Not wholly; but the method pursued to further
your purposes is far from my interpretation of
right."</p>

<p>"But the other ladies, many of them belong
to our church, and they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Over them, in such matters, I have but feeble
control," sighed the good man. "Were it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I would put a stop to the performance at any
cost."</p>

<p>"What's the harm, father?" asked Will, who
saw that his mother was certain to lose the argument,
and pitied her.</p>

<p>"William," said the parson, turning on his son,
"your knowledge of such matters is infinitesimal.
The stage is not real, it is but a show of puppets,
and by persons of uncertain character."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Will, "what have the morals
of actors got to do with the stage and plays?"</p>

<p>"What have the morals of a preacher got to
do with his sermons? In the church, and out of
it, is not every action watched, every word listened
to and repeated? Is he not supposed to be an
example?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father, but after all he is only a man."</p>

<p>"An exemplary one."</p>

<p>"Usually," said Will in a way that neither his
father nor mother understood. For several minutes
they ate in silence.</p>

<p>"I thought," began Mrs. Flint with renewed
courage, "that Shakespeare's works were above
reproach."</p>

<p>"So they are; there's no finer reading, no
clearer understanding of human nature than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the plays of Shakespeare; but the performance
of them is simply the making believe by actors
that they are what they are not," patiently explained
the parson. Will choked over his coffee
in an effort to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>"Of course," sighed Mrs. Flint, resignedly,
"if you insist I will leave the club."</p>

<p>"Let your action be guided by your own judgment,
and consideration for the principles which
I believe to be true. Perhaps the example of a
worthy sister of our church who has already taken
the step may make it easier for you to decide,"
said the parson in milder tones.</p>

<p>"Why, whom do you mean?" asked Mrs.
Flint in surprise.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Deacon Walton."</p>

<p>"Has she resigned?"</p>

<p>"She has, or will at the next meeting, so her
husband informed me last evening."</p>

<p>"Then of course I must do likewise," said
Mrs. Flint, a little piqued to learn that Mrs.
Walton had been the first to comply with the
demands of their church.</p>

<p>"I knew that you could be relied upon to do
your duty," replied the parson, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"But, father," said Will, quickly, with a trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
of indignation in his voice, "is it her duty to deny
herself something that she believes to be right?
Is it right for her to do a thing just because you
wish it?"</p>

<p>"I consider it so. Sometimes we do not see,
or understand, our duty as clearly as others. In
that case, when we are guided by some one who
is in a position to know, it is certainly right to do
a thing, which, at the time, is against our own
will." The parson was irritated by his son's
interference, and spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"You may be right, but I can't seem to understand,"
said Will, respectfully. "But then my
ideas, and ideals, are usually in opposition to
yours; you are always positive that you are right,
and I am equally certain that I am right; we are
father and son, why do we always differ?"</p>

<p>"You are young, I am old; the world changes,"
replied the parson, shortly.</p>

<p>"But other men of your age have changed with
the world."</p>

<p>"My son, while I do not live wholly in the past,
I must cling to the customs and beliefs of my
youth."</p>

<p>"But the stage, father," persisted Will, with
an earnestness that was strange for him, "in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
regard to that the ideas of most men have changed,
and no one has been harmed; in fact, have we not
been benefited?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the parson, "no one ever has,
or ever will, receive good from it." He had little
respect for the opinion of his son, rebelled at what
he considered his disrespectful argument, and was
determined not to budge from the stand which he
had taken.</p>

<p>"This performance that the club is to give,"
continued Will, "can do no harm, you must grant
that, and the ladies who are to take part are of
unquestioned character."</p>

<p>"True, in regard to the ladies, more's the pity;
but the play, my son, professional or amateur,
is wrong. As for the club itself, and all organizations
of women outside of the church, I am not
sure but that they are an unfortunate experiment&mdash;sowers
of discord and discontent." The parson
was unmistakably angry.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that women should not
be permitted to organize, to enjoy the companionship
of others, outside of the home, after the manner
of men? Do you believe that their ideals
should be fixed, and no opportunity given to
heighten and beautify them?" Will asked these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
questions with deliberation and without raising
his voice, yet there were unmistakable signs of a
controlled force that would have been impossible
in a man who did not love a woman. The parson
glared at his son for a moment before replying.
"I repeat, it is an experiment&mdash;an experiment,"
he growled as he left the table and went to his
study. Narrow was the way of this man, his
creed was his religion; he loved his books more
than he loved men; in name only was he a minister
of God.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, mother," said Will when the study
door was closed. "Are you going to resign?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, and there were tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"There's no need of it," said Will, quickly.</p>

<p>"I've got to," continued Mrs. Flint.</p>

<p>"No, you haven't," replied Will, savagely.</p>

<p>"Will!" exclaimed his mother. "It is your
father's wish."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Will, in a calmer tone, "if I
ever marry, I hope that I shall have sense enough
to let my wife decide such questions for herself."</p>

<p>"You, married?" said Mrs. Flint, "why,
Will, I&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I said, 'if,' mother," he laughed. "I must
go to work first, and then if I find some one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will, are you sure that you have not found
some one already?" she asked, and her voice
trembled.</p>

<p>Will turned and looked out of the window.
He dared not meet her eyes. Had his mother
guessed his secret?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Girl Talk</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> are you going to wear?" asked Fanny
Tweedie, one afternoon while she and Barbara
Wallace were rehearsing the scene from the
"Lady of Lyons" which they, with Mrs. Blake,
were to play at the club theatricals.</p>

<p>"What are the others, who are to play the part
of men, going to wear?" questioned Barbara
in reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, dresses fixed up in some outlandish way,
but I had hoped that you&mdash;" said the amateur
Pauline, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Would wear something out of the ordinary,"
Barbara interrupted, smilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fanny, "Claude Melnotte
should wear something&mdash;something unexpected."</p>

<p>Barbara laughed, but Fanny stood looking at
her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you laughing at, Barbara
Wallace?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"How would you define, or describe, an 'unexpected'
costume?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Fanny, "is that what amused
you? I meant something stunning, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that would make the people talk for weeks, something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me, don't go on like that, Fanny, it's
too horrible, too impossible. I have an idea for
a costume, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, tell me what your idea is."</p>

<p>"But I'm not sure yet. When&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, Barbara&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Fanny, I don't know myself. When I
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promise not to breathe a word," persisted
Fanny, coaxingly.</p>

<p>"You shall be the first to know when I have
decided," said Barbara. She liked Fanny despite
her shallow nature, and Fanny was "awfully
fond" of Barbara, and talked less about her to
others than she did about anybody else.</p>

<p>"There's no use talking," said Fanny when
she saw that Barbara could not be teased into
describing the costume she was to wear, "some
of the ladies are simply fearful in their parts, and
I'm afraid that they will be laughed at when they
appear in public."</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied Barbara, "if, by 'in
public,' you mean before the residents of Manville."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course that's what I mean," Fanny
continued. "<i>Everybody</i> will be there. The club
and what it is doing has caused more talk than
anything that has happened since the Declaration
of Independence. And since Mrs. Flint and Mrs.
Walton have resigned, and everybody knows that
<i>Mr.</i> Flint is dreadfully set against the club and
its theatricals, the Morning Glories have had a
boom."</p>

<p>"Some one certainly has advertised us," said
Barbara, much amused. Will had told her of the
domestic scene at the parsonage.</p>

<p>"I suppose," continued Fanny, "that you knew
all about Mrs. Flint's resigning before any of the
rest of us." Barbara's face betrayed her. "Aren't
you mean," Fanny went on, "not to tell."</p>

<p>"You little goose," replied Barbara, "what
would you think of me if I ran and told everything
that I knew about the minister's family&mdash;supposing
that I ever did know anything about their
affairs." Fanny did not think it mean for some
folks to run and tell, but she would have been
surprised if Barbara had done so.</p>

<p>"You might tell <i>me</i>," she pouted.</p>

<p>Barbara put her arm about Fanny, girl-fashion,
and kissed her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fanny, dear," she said, "there's something
that I will tell you, something that I haven't told
to a soul in the whole world." Fanny was all
smiles and attention in an instant, and warmly
squeezed Barbara's hand.</p>

<p>"I knew you would," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flint&mdash;" Barbara began, but Fanny
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"The minister?"</p>

<p>"No, the other Mr. Flint."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Mr. Flint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you call him Will, or Billy?"</p>

<p>Barbara did not choose to answer that question.
A <i>Mr.</i> persistently used, is often a good sign&mdash;for
the young man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flint," Barbara began again, "is going
away."</p>

<p>"To work?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that lovely!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Barbara, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I mean, isn't it splendid to think that he is
going to do something&mdash;be somebody."</p>

<p>"Was he not somebody before?" asked Barbara,
quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but&mdash;you know how people
have talked about him."</p>

<p>"And half that they have said is not true,"
said Barbara, resentfully.</p>

<p>"You and I know it, but the others don't.
Most folks like to hear and believe horrible things
about somebody else." (Fanny was wiser than
she knew.) "When is he going?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"And aren't you going to see him again before
he goes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Barbara replied as a pink flush spread
over her cheeks, "to-night."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Jingle Bells</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> four o'clock the next morning Mrs. Tweedie
was awakened by the ringing of the door-bell.
She sat up in bed and listened until it rang again.</p>

<p>"Ezra," she whispered, as she shook her
sleeping husband.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Ezra, sleepily.</p>

<p>"Some one is ringing the door-bell."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he yawned.</p>

<p>"How should I know? Get up and see."</p>

<p>Ezra crawled out of bed, lighted a lamp, put
on his dressing-gown, and started down-stairs.
When he had gone Mrs. Tweedie got up, put on
her glasses, lighted a match, peered at the clock,
and then muttered, "Disgraceful!"</p>

<p>Ezra asked, "Who is it?" before opening the
door, and when he recognized the voice that
replied nearly dropped the lamp so great was his
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Miss Wallace!" he gasped, as he opened
the door.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that I had to disturb you, Mr.
Tweedie," was all that Barbara said as she hurried
past him. Ezra closed and locked the door, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
up-stairs, looked at the clock and then at his
wife.</p>

<p>"Where has she been?" he asked, as he blew
out the light, and got into bed.</p>

<p>"What does it matter where she has been?"
replied Mrs. Tweedie. "Is it not enough that she
has been <i>out</i> until four o'clock in the morning?"
Ezra certainly thought it strange, but did not
venture to offer any excuses. "And to think,"
continued Mrs. Tweedie, "after all that we have
done for her (and Barbara had paid for), that she
should bring disgrace to our home in this manner!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear," replied Mr. Tweedie, soothingly,
"perhaps there is some good reason."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" snapped his wife. Ezra gave
it up and went to sleep, but Mrs. Tweedie spent
the remainder of the night thinking dreadful
things, and the most exasperating thought was
that she did not know&mdash;she could only imagine.</p>

<p>The explanation or true story of the events of
that night (escapade it was called afterward by
many) was simple, though none the less important
to those most concerned. Barbara had been
invited by Will Flint to go on a sleigh-ride. She
was ready at the appointed time, and, hearing
him drive up and stop, had gone out before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
came to the door without telling Mrs. Tweedie
where she was going. Mrs. Tweedie considered
this omission a suspicious circumstance. She sat
up until eleven o'clock, and then, being determined
to know at what time Barbara returned, locked
the door so that it could not be opened with a
latch-key, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Will and Barbara chatted cheerfully as they
drove away from the village into the real country
where they were alone with the black forest, the
fields of glistening snow, and the great white
moon. Will was happy, and Barbara&mdash;at first
she had regretted her promise to go, but after an
hour had gone by a feeling of contentment and
security stole over her, and she too was happy.</p>

<p>They had turned toward home and were going
down a hill at a rapid gait when one of the runners
of the sleigh slipped into an icy rut, and the
borrowed, dilapidated affair collapsed. Nothing
was injured except the sleigh, but they were ten
miles from home, and not a house in sight. After
Will had crawled out of the wreck, and helped
Barbara to disentangle herself, he unhitched the
horse and drew the remains of the sleigh to the
side of the road. There was nothing for them to
do except walk, so they started off with the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
led behind. The nearest house was three miles,
but Barbara and Will did not know when they
passed it, or the next, and would not have stopped
if they had. Their thoughts were of each other
and the future, as they walked, hand in hand,
along the white road that gleamed in the moonlight,
and stretched away into&mdash; Only Barbara
and Will, and the tired old horse plodding along
behind, knew just what was said during that walk,
but when they arrived at Mrs. Tweedie's gate
Barbara had a man's love in her keeping, and
Will had the promise of an answer when he had
won it.</p>

<p>At breakfast that morning Barbara told that
part of the story necessary to explain the hour at
which she had returned. Fanny thought it must
have been a great lark, and Mr. Tweedie and
Tommy agreed with her, but Mrs. Tweedie
looked sour and incredulous.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mrs. Tweedie learned that
Will Flint had left town early that morning. Here
was a mystery, she thought, and she did not rest
until the whole story, or all that she could gather
and imagine of it, was tucked away in her head
with all the rest of her false ideas and ideals.
In collecting the details she had found it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to barter news for news, and when she had finished
her calls, all Manville knew that Barbara Wallace
and Will Flint had been on a sleigh-ride the night
before, and had not returned until four o'clock
that morning.</p>

<p>Poor Barbara, she anticipated disagreeable
talk, but thoughts of those hours of the night
before, and the earnest love of a strong man, soon
drove away her fears. He had gone, but for her
sake, and when he returned she knew what her
answer would be.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>More Talk</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Are</span> we all here?" asked Mrs. Tweedie, one
afternoon as she glanced about Miss Sawyer's
parlour to see how many members of the play
committee were present.</p>

<p>"All except Miss Wallace," Miss Sawyer
replied, when she had counted noses.</p>

<p>"And she will not be here," said Mrs. Tweedie,
quickly. "The schools have been opened."</p>

<p>"Ain't it a relief to have the children in school
again, Mis' Jones?" asked Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," replied Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Stout, Mrs. Jones!" exclaimed
Miss Sawyer. "Do you send your children to
school merely to relieve yourselves of responsibility?
I have thought always that children were sent to
school to be educated."</p>

<p>"So they are," replied Mrs. Stout, "but if
they can be educated, and at the same time be
kept away from home long enough ev'ry day to
give their mothers a chance to do the housework,
why, I say that school is a twin blessin'."</p>

<p>"That is just what I think," said Mrs. Jones,
in an amen sort of way. "And I'm sure that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
children in Miss Wallace's school have an excellent
woman to instruct and care for them."</p>

<p>"As a teacher, yes," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
"but&mdash;" she stopped abruptly, and looked wise.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Fanny, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Fanny, I am capable of managing such
affairs without the interference of girls," replied
Mrs. Tweedie, sharply.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but is it not time to begin our
meeting?" Miss Sawyer asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is!" replied Mrs. Stout. "The play
committee's off the track again."</p>

<p>"Well, let us get on to the track and go ahead,"
said Mrs. Tweedie, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"What's this meetin' for, anyway?" asked
Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>The ladies looked inquiringly at Miss Sawyer,
who had called them together.</p>

<p>"There are many details," she began, "to be
worked out in regard to our entertainment: programmes,
tickets, music, advertising&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by Mrs. Stout who was
suddenly overcome by a spasm of laughter.</p>

<p>"Advertisin'!" she choked, "people for ten
miles&mdash;" another burst of laughter prevented
her from continuing for a moment. "People for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
ten miles 'round are talkin' about nothin' else.
Don't spend a cent for advertisin'."</p>

<p>"Quite true," added Mrs. Tweedie, "our club
and entertainment are in the mouths of everybody."</p>

<p>"And I'm 'fraid they've got a hard pill to
swaller," said Mrs. Stout, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Mrs. Tweedie quickly
demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin' against anybody in pertic'ler,
only it has struck me that some of us old women
in the show are goin' to be dreadful funny when
we ain't s'posed to be."</p>

<p>"The people know that we do not pretend to
be more than amateurs," pleaded Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"I know that," replied Mrs. Stout, "but there
are good and bad amatoors."</p>

<p>"It is too bad of you to say such things, Mrs.
Stout," said Mrs. Blake. "I am sure that we
shall do quite as well as we are expected to do."</p>

<p>"Of course," smiled Mrs. Stout, "but we're
bound to make mistakes, and we don't want to
be any bigger fools than we can help."</p>

<p>"Fools indeed!" snapped Mrs. Tweedie, "I
am sure that the ladies who are to take part in our
entertainment are of exceptional intelligence and
ability&mdash;with one or two exceptions."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm prob'ly the biggest exception," said
Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"I mentioned no names," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"You don't have to," retorted Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie's face was flushed with anger.
The others looked frightened, they feared that
the open rupture between Mrs. Stout and Mrs.
Tweedie, which had been brewing since the first
meeting of the club, was about to take place.
But Mrs. Tweedie's anger was too intense for
words, and after glaring at the cause of her wrath
for a moment, she sank back in her chair with the
last word trembling on her lips&mdash;unspoken.</p>

<p>To dictate, to be absolute, was Mrs. Tweedie's
joy&mdash;her life; but her power was waning, though
she did not realize it. A mild spirit of rebellion
had crept into the minds of some of the members
which promised to bear fruit before the expiration
of her term of office. Mrs. Stout, the only outspoken
rebel, caused Mrs. Tweedie more annoyance
than any other member because she would
speak truths that were certain to hit somebody,
and Mrs. Tweedie always presented the most
tempting mark.</p>

<p>"What have you learned concerning the orchestra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Mrs. Jones?" asked Miss Sawyer when
the temporary cessation of talk had cleared away
the clouds.</p>

<p>"Orchestra!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, without
giving Mrs. Jones a chance to reply. "An orchestra
will cost too much. Can't we get somebody
to play the piano for nothing? We're
tryin' to make money&mdash;anybody can spend
it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie had set her heart upon having
an orchestra, and immediately trained her guns
on Mrs. Stout's economical proposition and
opened fire.</p>

<p>"Money is not the only thing," she said,
epigrammatically. "We must not forget what
we owe to art. To my mind orchestral music is
an absolutely essential adjunct to a Thespian
production."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's so," replied Mrs. Stout,
doubtfully. "I ain't quite pos'tive."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie smiled. With her big words she
had scored a bull's-eye.</p>

<p>"As for the money," Mrs. Stout continued,
"maybe it ain't the 'only thing,' but it comes
precious near it."</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Stout," said Fanny Tweedie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"we've just <i>got</i> to make a 'hit' with our first
entertainment."</p>

<p>"Fanny, we are not talking about baseball,"
remonstrated Mrs. Tweedie, who had absorbed
unconsciously some knowledge of the national
game from her son Thomas, and for the moment
forgot the application to the stage of the word in
question.</p>

<p>"The word 'hit' means success on the stage,"
replied Fanny. "Does it not, Miss Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I have seen the word so used in the newspapers,"
answered Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"The newspapers," said Mrs. Tweedie, sharply,
"are not written in the best English."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they ain't," interposed Mrs. Stout,
"but they're written the way most of us talk and
so that we can understand 'em."</p>

<p>"The word has little to do with the business
before us," snapped Mrs. Tweedie, dismissing
the subject. "You mentioned programmes and
tickets, Miss Sawyer, what about them?"</p>

<p>"The expense will be only a trifle; I suppose
Mr. Hunter will do the printing," replied Miss
Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Tweedie, in a positive
way that the ladies did not like, because Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Hunter was Mrs. Tweedie's cousin, a descendant
of the famous ancestor. "And now," she continued,
"is there anything else that has not been
attended to?"</p>

<p>"Has the hall been hired?" asked Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Really!" exclaimed Miss Sawyer, "I had
wholly forgotten it!"</p>

<p>"You'd better get after it quick, or some of the
men folks will get ahead of us with some kind of
a political meetin'," said Mrs. Stout. "Then
we'll have to 'stoop to conquer' all right."</p>

<p>"You will attend to the matter to-day, Miss
Sawyer?" Mrs. Tweedie asked, and upon receiving
an affirmative nod continued, "And now,
if there is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," interrupted Mrs. Jones, "what shall
we do about Mr. Flint? He is so firmly opposed
to our entertainment that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's our advertisin' agent," remarked Mrs.
Stout, irreverently.</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> we do?" said Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"What can <i>he</i> do?" asked Fanny.</p>

<p>"It grieves me," Mrs. Tweedie began, "to
think that we are engaged upon an enterprise to
which our worthy pastor is so much opposed, but
I do not see my way clear to yield to his opposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Surely the club cannot give up the entertainment."</p>

<p>"All we can do," said Mrs. Stout, "is to go
ahead with the show and pay no attention to what
he says."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout, our entertainment is not to be a
'show' in any sense," replied Mrs. Tweedie,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"As I said once before to-day, it may be for
some of us," retorted Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Well, I attend Mr. Flint's church," said Mrs.
Jones, "and have the greatest respect for him, but
I must say that I cannot fully agree with him in
his ideas about the stage."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Miss Sawyer.</p>

<p>"He's too stiff-backed for me," was Mrs.
Stout's contribution.</p>

<p>"Me too," chirped Fanny, and her mother and
Mrs. Blake silently agreed with the others. For
once they were of one mind. Mr. Flint could
rave until he was hoarse.</p>

<p>"For the land sakes!" suddenly exclaimed
Mrs. Stout, as she sat up very straight with her
eyes fixed upon something on the other side of
the room. Then, as though controlled by some
mysterious, irresistible force, she got up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
walked toward the mantel, and when near enough
to be sure that her eyes were not deceiving her,
stopped. "If it ain't a picture of Sam Billin's!"</p>

<p>Miss Sawyer blushed, and wondered how she
could have been so careless. Poor Lizzie, with her
Sam was a sort of "forlorn hope," and everybody
knew it, but Mrs. Stout did not spare her.</p>

<p>"It's usually pretty serious when he gets 'round
to givin' his picture," she said. "I wouldn't have
believed it, Miss Sawyer, because Sam ain't exactly
your kind. To be sure he's got some good
points, but he ain't literary a mite."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout," said Mrs. Tweedie, angrily,
"we came here this morning to transact business
connected with our entertainment, and <i>not</i> to
meddle with the affairs of others."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mrs. Stout, good-naturedly,
"we seem to have done both pretty well."</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> be going," said Mrs. Jones, as she
jumped up and bustled about getting her things
and began putting them on. The others followed
her example and thus again was the rupture that
seemed inevitable between Mrs. Tweedie and
Mrs. Stout postponed.</p>

<p>When they had gone Miss Sawyer took the
photograph of Sam Billings from the mantel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
looked at it for a long time, and then, with a sigh
which could not be suppressed, she hid the picture
in a drawer beneath a package of photographs
of forgotten friends.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Two Letters</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Will&mdash;friend:</span>&mdash;Since my last letter much
has happened in Manville of interest to us both&mdash;more
than I have time to tell now. The
schools opened last Monday, and the children
really seemed glad to get back&mdash;especially the
dirty ones. I have discovered that work gives
more happiness than idleness and the gossip of
the village.</p>

<p>Many versions of the story of our accident have
been circulated the length and breadth of the land.
Since then Mrs. Tweedie has kept me at arm's
length, but Fanny has become a real friend, one
whom I need and appreciate.</p>

<p>Every spare moment we spend rehearsing the
scene that we are to give at the club entertainment.</p>

<p>The Morning Glories are blooming all the time,
and the entertainment is expected to be the event
of the season.</p>

<p>I called on the Duncans yesterday. Rufe has
reformed, temporarily, at least, and Mrs. Duncan,
poor creature, is happier than she has been for
many years.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>They had found out who put the flowers on
little Bessie's grave, and were very grateful.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Stout continues to keep people and
things stirred up. I imagine that her motto must
be "The Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing
but the Truth." I never would have believed
that the truth spoken at all times, regardless of
anybody and everything, could be so amusingly
disturbing.</p>

<p>What you have written about your work is very
interesting&mdash;please tell me more. Whenever I
rehearse the part that I am to play there are
many&mdash;many lines that send my thoughts to you.
The closing words are best: "All angels guard
and keep you."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Barbara:</span>&mdash;Until I went away and
began to receive your letters I never knew what
a real letter was like. When I was at college,
father wrote me a weekly sermon, and mother
sent pages of don'ts. They are doing the same
now, but you send me what I need&mdash;cheerfulness
and encouragement.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>My work continues to be interesting, though
hard, but hard work is what I need, too. Until now,
I never knew how satisfying it could be. I never
knew what it was to feel like a man until I began
the struggle urged on by love for a good woman.</p>

<p>From your letters I have received the impression
that my native town is being stirred up in a manner
that must be a revelation to the inhabitants
who have been asleep for so many years. If the
Morning Glories never do anything else they
will have accomplished a great deal. I know that
you will be splendid in your part, and hope to be
able to come down to see you, but cannot be sure
until the last moment.</p>

<p>I have resumed my evening studies and take
much pleasure in them.</p>

<p>Since I have been here I have attended church
regularly&mdash;something that I have not done since
I was physically big enough to refuse&mdash;and
please don't laugh when I confess that I enjoy the
service very much.</p>

<p>The sermons are different from any that I have
ever heard before. The clergyman seems to be
talking to <i>me</i>, about clean thoughts and right
living. And when the service is over I feel stronger
and better, and that the world is a beautiful place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
It is beautiful, Barbara, because you are in it.
Each day I long so much to see you. What is
there that I would not give for one moment in
your presence? As it is, your letters are my life.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Advertising</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> d'y'," said Sam Billings, one morning
as he sauntered into Stout's Grocery, where the
proprietor was busily engaged sorting a barrel of
apples.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," replied Peter.</p>

<p>"Nice kind of weather."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How's things?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' to complain about."</p>

<p>"You're lucky."</p>

<p>"You mean I 'tend to business."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with luck?"</p>

<p>"Most everything."</p>

<p>"What you gettin' for apples now?" Sam
asked as he picked up one of the largest and took
a huge bite.</p>

<p>"Nothin'&mdash;for some," replied Peter, without
looking up.</p>

<p>"Give 'em away?" munched Sam, innocently.</p>

<p>"Don't have to."</p>

<p>"You mean some folks pay, and some folks
don't?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' like that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"And them that do pay have to make up for
them that don't," Sam chuckled, wisely.</p>

<p>"That's about it," replied Peter, wearily, as he
rolled the empty barrel toward the rear of the
store.</p>

<p>"Say, Peter," said Sam, following, "I want
to borrer some big sheets of wrappin' paper
and your markin' ink and brush, if you don't
mind."</p>

<p>"Goin' to write a letter?" grinned Peter.</p>

<p>"Now, Peter, quit your teasin'. I'll tell you
all about it when it's finished."</p>

<p>"All right, help yourself," said Peter, as he
went behind the counter, and turned an attentive
ear, and a smiling what-will-you-have-this-morning
look on a customer who had just come
in.</p>

<p>Sam took twenty-five or thirty of the largest
sheets of wrapping-paper he could find, and went
into the back room where the oil, molasses, vinegar,
empty boxes, etc., were kept. After rummaging
about for a few minutes he found the marking
ink and brush. Then he spread one of the sheets
of paper on a bench, dipped the brush in the ink,
and eyed the paper with a how-shall-I-begin
look. Five minutes later Peter came out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
draw some oil and found him in the same attitude.</p>

<p>"Got somethin' on your mind, Sam?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Eh! Oh, yes," Sam replied, "I say, Peter,
have you got any old show-bills?"</p>

<p>"There's one in the window 'bout the firemen's
'play-out' over to Union Corners."</p>

<p>"That won't do."</p>

<p>"Well, then there's some old circus bills pasted
on the inside of the barn door," said Peter, as he
squatted in front of the kerosene barrel and began
filling a can.</p>

<p>"I dunno, guess I'll take a look at 'em anyway,"
replied Sam, doubtfully, as he started out
of the back door toward the barn.</p>

<p>Peter watched through the doorway, and
wondered what Sam was up to until he was called
back to business by the kerosene which was
running over the top of the can.</p>

<p>Sam returned to the back room after an absence
of ten minutes, took up his brush and eagerly
went to work. After half an hour's labour he
had painted something that resembled a homemade
no-trespassing-beware-of-the-dog sign upside
down, which read:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
"<b>BIG SHOW</b><br />

CLUB in<br />
<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.<br />
</div>

<div class='blockquot'><span class="smcap">Veterans Hall Manville</span> Wed. Evg. Feb. 17,

<span class="smcap">children</span> 15 cents EXTRA, no <span class="smcap">children</span> and
dogs in ARMS not admitted."</div>

<p>Sam held up the sheet and read it again and
again with pride. His only regret was that he
had no red or green paint to heighten the effect
and make the poster a work of real art.</p>

<p>"Peter," he called, when he was sure that his
work could not be improved, and when Peter
appeared in the doorway, asked: "What do you
think of that?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, slowly, after he had read
the poster, "it shows up some."</p>

<p>"I should say it did," replied Sam, proudly.
"And it's jest what the show needs. Ev'ry
house and barn for ten miles 'round oughter be
papered with 'em inside and out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your idea?" queried Peter.</p>

<p>"Ev'ry word."</p>

<p>"What you goin' to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Make a dozen more and stick 'em up 'round."</p>

<p>"Does the club women folks know?" asked
Peter.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;I've talked it over with
one of the officers," replied Sam, hesitating suspiciously.
"And she kinder thought that some
advertisin' ought to be done, though they didn't
want to spend any money doin' it. So I thought
I'd help 'em out and s'prise 'em at the same
time."</p>

<p>"They'll be surprised all right," said Peter,
grinning.</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Guess they'll think my advertisin' scheme's
all right."</p>

<p>"Hope so, for your sake," replied Peter, as
he returned to his work.</p>

<p>Sam worked industriously during the remainder
of the forenoon, and by noontime had finished
twelve more posters just like the first.</p>

<p>"Mind if I put one of these up on the outside
of the store?" he asked, as he emerged from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
back room with one of the posters carefully held
up in front of himself.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Peter, who was busy and
had been bothered enough for one morning.
Ten minutes later the poster was exposed on the
front of the store where the public&mdash;when it
happened that way&mdash;could see it. Sam was
patiently waiting for the first passer-by when
Alick Purbeck drove up. Alick read the poster
through, and then gave a long whistle.</p>

<p>"Well, what you got to say?" asked Sam,
who had watched from the doorway for the effect
of the poster on Alick.</p>

<p>"Reads like a circus; some of your doin's,
I'll bet," Alick replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis; you don't know a good thing when
you see it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," retorted Alick, "but I know
some folks in town that will appreciate it. If you
knew how much paint you'd got on your face,
you'd go and stick your head into a bucket of
turpentine."</p>

<p>Sam sneered at Alick's remark, but, though he
did have some misgivings as to how his work
would be received, was determined to carry out
his original plan. Without deigning to look or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
speak to Alick or Peter, he went into the store,
filled his mouth with tacks, put a hammer in his
pocket, took another poster, and went across the
street to Mr. Flint's church, where he tacked
the poster on to the bulletin board over the notice
of an oyster party.</p>

<p>The opposition of Mr. Flint to the stage in
general, and the club entertainment in particular,
did not occur to Sam. His only thought was that
the church was a good and conspicuous place
for a poster.</p>

<p>Alick Purbeck watched from the doorway when
Sam started across the road, and when he saw what
his object was called Peter.</p>

<p>"See what that blamed fool's doin'," he said.</p>

<p>"He'll get set on so hard some day that he'll
know it," was Peter's comment.</p>

<p>When the poster was secure in its place, Sam
walked slowly backward until he reached the
middle of the road, where he stopped with his
hands in his pockets, his head cocked to one side,
and viewed his work with a critical eye. He had
been there but a moment when Doctor Jones
drove up, and when he saw Sam's peculiar attitude
stopped.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam, what do you see that is so absorbing?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he asked, after waiting a moment for
Sam to move or speak. In reply Sam waved
his hand proudly toward the poster on the church.</p>

<p>The doctor looked and read.</p>

<p>"Some of your work?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"So you are the club's advertising agent?"</p>

<p>"Nope," replied Sam, modestly. "I jest
wanted to help 'em out a little."</p>

<p>"Very kind, I'm sure," said the doctor, as he
drove away wondering who had made the mistake.</p>

<p>When Sam returned to the store he found Alick
Purbeck standing in the doorway grinning.</p>

<p>"Do you expect to live long, Sam?" asked
Alick.</p>

<p>Sam pushed by without replying, went to the
back room, rolled up the remaining posters,
walked out of the store without looking to the
right or left, and marched off up the road.</p>

<p>By nightfall twelve more of Sam's posters were
displayed in as many conspicuous places, and before
the last one had been tacked up the whole
town&mdash;except the members of the Morning
Glory Club&mdash;was laughing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tweedie was furious when Tommy asked
if he could go to the "Big Show," and poor Ezra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
he would have thought it funny had not his wife
scolded the whole evening just as though he was
to blame.</p>

<p>That night, after they were abed, Mrs. Stout
told Peter, among other things, that he didn't
have the sense of a half-grown puppy to let that
fool of a Sam Billings do such a thing. When she
had finished it was time for Peter to get up&mdash;and
he thought so, too.</p>

<p>The Reverend Elijah Flint was in a terrible
rage (state of righteous indignation). He went
to the church as soon as he heard of the outrage,
tore the offending poster into fragments, and
vehemently declared that the perpetrator of the
crime should be punished to the full extent of the
law.</p>

<p>And Miss Sawyer, poor Lizzie, she knew that
it was her fault, and bemoaned her indiscretion
in mentioning advertising to Sam Billings. She
wept all night, and vowed that she would never
speak to him again as long as she lived.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>More Advertising</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Mrs. Tweedie sent messages
by her son Thomas to the members of the
play committee requesting them to meet at her
home that afternoon to consider a matter of "distressing
importance." At two o'clock all of the
committee had complied with the request, excepting
Miss Sawyer, who sent word that she was
"indisposed," and she might truthfully have
added "to come."</p>

<p>"Ladies," Mrs. Tweedie began, solemnly,
"yesterday one of the <i>other sex</i>, an unprincipled
creature by the name of Billings, inflicted upon
our club an irreparable injury. You have seen
or at least heard of the hideous posters that
some time yesterday were put up in a dozen or
more conspicuous places about town. Furthermore,
the sensitive feelings of an educated and
highly respected citizen have been deeply wounded
by this act of wantonness&mdash;I refer to the Reverend
Mr. Flint. One of the posters was placed,
and remained for several hours, upon the bulletin
of his, I might say our, church. We all know
Mr. Flint's aversion to anything pertaining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the stage, yet he has refrained from speaking of
our entertainment publicly out of regard for the
members of his church who are interested in the
club. What his attitude from now on will be I
dare not conjecture. As for the miserable villain
who is responsible for the outrage&mdash;words fail
to express my feelings."</p>

<p>"Quote Shakespeare," suggested Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"This is not the time for jesting, Mrs.
Stout," replied Mrs. Tweedie, in a tone that would
have withered any one but Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows it better than I do," she retorted.
"I've got reason to be as mortified as
anybody, because the outlandish work was
begun in my husband's store. Of course, he
ain't to blame, but he ought to have told the
fool that what he was doin' would make
trouble."</p>

<p>"No one attaches any blame upon you or
your husband," Mrs. Tweedie replied.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Mrs. Jones, "that I cannot
see how Mr. Stout had anything to do with it.
It seems to me that it was not done maliciously,
any way, but more in the spirit of a practical
joke."</p>

<p>"Practical meddlesomeness!" snapped Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Stout; "and the man that did it was set up to
it, in my opinion, by a woman in this club!"</p>

<p>The ladies looked at Mrs. Stout, and then at
each other in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Tweedie. "If
you are so positive pray tell us about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't exactly positive," Mrs. Stout
began, slowly, "but I guess at things sometimes,
and come pretty near bein' right, 'specially when
two and two make four. I ain't a woman that'll
hurt anybody's good name unless it's been rightly
damaged before by theirselves. In this case I
ain't sure, so I won't mention no names, only say
what I think made Sam Billin's do what he did."
Poor Mrs. Stout, for the first time in her life she
failed to find the direct path to the point, and
wallowed helplessly about in a meaningless slough
of words. "Well," she continued, "I don't
seem to be gettin' ahead very fast, but what I
wanted to say was this: You know that we talked
some about advertisin' at a meetin' of the committee
awhile ago, and decided not to spend any
money on it, but after the meetin' was over that
day one of the ladies said to me as we was goin'
home that <i>she</i> thought that somethin' ought to
be done about advertisin'. Now, I think that she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
or somebody else that thought same as she did,
must have talked with Sam Billin's, and told
him her opinion about advertisin', and he agreed
with her, and went off and done it."</p>

<p>The ladies were disappointed. The delicious
bit of scandal that they had anticipated was not
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"What you have told us," said Mrs. Tweedie,
"is very indefinite."</p>

<p>"It's about as definite as anything I hear at
the club, only I didn't mention no names&mdash;some
folks ain't so careful," retorted Mrs. Stout, who
was angry with herself.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Mrs. Jones, "we are just as
much in the dark as ever. We know what has
been done, and who did it, the question is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are we goin' to do about it?" interrupted
Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"We owe Mr. Flint an apology," Mrs. Tweedie
replied.</p>

<p>"That's easy," said Mrs. Stout, "and don't
cost anything."</p>

<p>"The virtue of dutifulness has nothing to do
with ease or cost," replied Mrs. Tweedie, loftily.
"I shall write the letter myself, and assume the
full responsibility. Now, in regard to the creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that committed the crime, shall we take any legal
steps?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, in
alarm. "Legal steps cost ten dollars apiece, and
there's no tellin' where they'll lead to."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this remark, and apparently
good nature was restored.</p>

<p>"It would only mean more advertising," said
Mrs. Blake, "and that is just what we are objecting
to now."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Mrs. Stout; "we've been
advertised worse'n a circus or soap; let's hide our
bright and shinin' light under a basket for
awhile."</p>

<p>After the ladies had gone Mrs. Tweedie had
only time to scold Fanny, give Dora some instructions
about dinner, tell Ezra that "If you
had a woman's club on your hands you would
have been insane weeks ago," which Ezra thought
very likely, when the Reverend Elijah Flint was
announced. Despite the trials of the previous
twenty-four hours, Mrs. Tweedie assumed a
humble look as she entered the parlour and
greeted her solemn-visaged pastor.</p>

<p>"I have called, Mrs. Tweedie," he began, after
declining to be seated, "on a matter of grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
importance to our church and myself. Perhaps
it will not be necessary for me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Flint," she said, with
proper gravity.</p>

<p>"Do you fully realize the false position in
which our church has been placed?" asked the
parson, impressively.</p>

<p>"I do, and sincerely regret the unfortunate
circumstance."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate," he repeated, as though he did
not think the word adequate. "Mrs. Tweedie,
our church has been defiled, desecrated, by a
wanton, worthless wretch, and I desire to know
whether your club, or any member of it, is responsible,
even in the slightest degree, for the
outrage."</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge," replied Mrs. Tweedie&mdash;but
she had guessed, with Mrs. Stout's assistance.</p>

<p>"I am profoundly relieved to hear you say
so," said Mr. Flint, as he started toward the door.
"Of course, you know my convictions regarding
the stage?" Mrs. Tweedie bowed affirmatively.
"I have refrained from expressing myself publicly,"
he continued, as he stopped with his hand
on the door-knob, "but since the occurrence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
yesterday, I feel that it is my duty to announce
from the pulpit next Sunday my position in regard
to the matter. Good afternoon."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Tweedie closed the door on the parson
she groaned: "More advertising."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Big Show</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the February day appointed for the Morning
Glory theatricals, the sun shone brightly&mdash;all
nature was the same, but in Manville the day
seemed different. Expectancy was in the air, and
suppressed excitement in the heads of those possessing
a bit of yellow pasteboard that entitled
them to admission to the "Big Show." The
men paused often at their work to talk of the
event, and the women, especially the members
of the club, forgot their families, their
housework&mdash;everything except the approaching
event.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a half-dozen of the club-women
were at the hall superintending the unloading
and disposition of a load of furniture
which had been collected from the homes of particularly
enthusiastic members. This unavoidable
inconvenience, which usually accompanies other
preparations for amateur theatricals, was especially
necessary in this case in order that the
barren stage might be properly dressed, and the
shabby scenery saved from loneliness. The
whole club turned out in the afternoon, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
hall and stage became a scene of bustling, chattering
confusion. As the crisis approached Miss
Sawyer, as stage directress, failed in her attempts
to control the situation, and Mrs. Tweedie,
"the powerful," as she was now called by many,
assumed command, and became more dignified
and dictatorial than ever.</p>

<p>At six o'clock the stage was set for the first
scene, and some of the ladies were nervously pacing
the creaking boards, book in hand, muttering
their lines, and gesticulating ridiculously in a
final spasmodic effort. In a corner of the hall
Miss Sawyer was murmuring to a bunch of
withered flowers; in an anteroom Mrs. Stout
was being coached by Mrs. Jones in the pronunciation
of some difficult words, and in a corridor
Mrs. Thornton was trying to console Mrs. Darling,
whose costume had not arrived.</p>

<p>The doors were opened to the public at seven
o'clock, with Ezra Tweedie on guard to take
tickets, and his son Tommy to distribute programmes.
Ezra was smilingly happy because it
was the first time for years that he had been permitted
to do anything in public. He would have
missed this chance if Mrs. Tweedie could have arranged
in any other way to keep in touch with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
box office. The public was ready when the doors
were opened, and charged unceremoniously upon
Ezra, Tommy, and the lady ushers, with pinks
in their hair, all of whom had more than they
could properly do during the next hour. At
eight o'clock the hall was filled with the "best"
people in Manville, and some of the worst&mdash;worst,
perhaps, only because they did not have
the price of a seat in the front rows. The last
person to enter was Sam Billings, who acted as
though he did not care to have his presence
known. Ezra scowled harmlessly as he took his
ticket. Sam peeked cautiously into the hall, then
turned to Ezra with a triumphant look and
whispered: "Advertisin' pays, don't it?"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after the time advertised for the
performance to begin the audience was suddenly
hushed to a funereal stillness by Mrs. Tweedie's
two bells&mdash;she would have things shipshape,
and succeeded, barring the orchestra, which had
been found to be too expensive. The curtain
was encouraged on its ascent by the strains of
"My Old Kentucky Home," played on the piano
by a Miss Bean, a member of Mr. Flint's church,
who, in a spirit of fashionable recklessness in
regard to her pastor's opinion, had consented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
play. Despite the music, perhaps because of it,
the curtain balked when half-way up, then stuck
fast. While the cause of the trouble was being
investigated, accompanied by the sound of hurrying
footsteps and loud whispers from "behind the
scenes," Miss Bean continued to play "My Old
Kentucky Home." When she was approaching
the end of the piece for the sixth time, the curtain
was yanked up sufficiently for the audience to
get a two-thirds view of the stage.</p>

<p>The curtain certainly acted badly, but it was a
star in comparison with the majority of the performers.
It was fully three minutes after the
curtain was raised before Mrs. Stout, as the Duke
in the trial scene from the "Merchant of Venice,"
entered, followed by her "soot" in single file.
Ten minutes later everybody knew that those
who had said that the people of Manville would
not, or could not, appreciate Shakespeare, did
not know what they were talking about.</p>

<p>The scene was a decided hit, and was talked
about for years afterward as the funniest thing
that ever happened in Manville.</p>

<p>The balcony scene, from "Romeo and Juliet,"
which followed, performed by Fanny Tweedie as
Juliet, and Mrs. Darling, in a rainy-day skirt, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Romeo, was more like real acting. It was enjoyed
by the audience, but not uproariously.</p>

<p>Then came the scene from the "Lady of Lyons"
in which Pauline discovers that she is the victim
of a trick. Fanny and Mrs. Blake played well, but
Barbara's costume and her appearance caused a
murmur of amazement. When she spoke, however,
the pathos of the conscience-stricken lover rang so
true that the gaping audience was instantly stilled.
For the moment men and women alike were fascinated,
though not many really approved, and
for this there was little cause for wonder. Barbara's
costume was new to Manville, and a surprise
even to the club-women. As Fanny Tweedie
had wished, it was "unexpected;" yet it was worn
innocently and with pure thought, although that
was something difficult for the narrow-minded to
understand.</p>

<p>The closing feature of the entertainment was
the production of Miss Sawyer's original play,
"Yellow Roses" ("First time on any stage"),
which withered and died a painless death.</p>

<p>The curtain fell&mdash;part way&mdash;at eleven-thirty,
with the audience "all present."</p>

<p>Despite the contrariness of the curtain, the
lapses of memory, the long waits, and the slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
taken cues, the people of Manville enjoyed the
"Big Show."</p>

<p>When the audience had gone, Mrs. Stout, with
wrinkled forehead, sat at a table counting the
proceeds as best she could with some one asking
every moment, "How much did we make?"
Many of the ladies looked grave and were acting
strangely. There was much whispering going
on, but it ceased suddenly when Barbara and
Fanny came from the dressing-room ready to go
home.</p>

<p>"You're the star, Miss Wallace," called Mrs.
Stout, when she saw them. Barbara stopped
before her and smiled. "And your costume," she
continued, "was just the sweetest I ever saw."</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Tweedie approached,
her face showing intense anger.</p>

<p>"What are the receipts, Mrs. Stout?" she
asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Mrs. Stout replied. "I
was just tellin' Miss Wallace how much I liked
her costume. Did you ever see anything just
like it?"</p>

<p>"Never!" thundered Mrs. Tweedie.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't you think it was pretty?" asked
Mrs. Stout, in surprise.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was indecent!" hissed Mrs. Tweedie, as
she glared at Barbara.</p>

<p>Everybody was looking and listening, but, excepting
Fanny, too astonished to speak.</p>

<p>"Mother, how can you!" she exclaimed, indignantly,
but Mrs. Tweedie walked quickly into
the dressing-room, and slammed the door.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the tigeresses!" gasped Mrs.
Stout.</p>

<p>Barbara was stunned. Fanny led her from the
building, and on the way home tried to make
amends for her mother's anger. But Barbara
understood&mdash;the consciousness of her mistake
had come like a blow in the face. Oh, if Will
were only here, she thought. He had written that
he could not come to the performance, but had
sent all sorts of good wishes for her success. She
needed him now more than she had ever needed
a friend before.</p>

<p>The Tweedie family, excepting Tommy, argued
long and late that night concerning Barbara and
her costume. Mrs. Tweedie was the minority,
but she won, and her decision was that Barbara
must quit their roof the next day.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Day After</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever!" exclaimed Mrs. Darling, as
she ran into Mrs. Thornton's just after breakfast
the next morning to finish what she did not have
time to say the night before.</p>

<p>"You mean Miss Wallace?"</p>

<p>"Yes; did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have thought she'd dared!" said
Mrs. Darling, with a sanctimonious look on her
pretty face.</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Wonder what Mrs. Tweedie thinks."</p>

<p>"She was in a rage last night."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she was awfully angry."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't have dared to wear such a costume,
would <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not for worlds."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> pretty, though."</p>

<p>"And she looked terribly stunning."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm afraid that there'll be trouble
over it in the club."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder a mite."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I must be going; good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye; if you hear anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll run in; good-bye."</p>

<p>This was a sample of the talk that was going
on all over Manville the morning after the "Big
Show." Masters, mistresses, and maids, all were
talking; at front doors, back doors, in the
parlours, in the kitchens, on the corners&mdash;everywhere.
Few praised&mdash;many censured. And
poor Barbara, it was her name that was on every
lip. By night everybody in Manville had taken
sides for or against her, and, strange to relate,
more men than women were ready to defend her.</p>

<p>Stout's Grocery was the objective of many of
the male population that morning. Mr. Blake,
the undertaker, was the first to arrive.</p>

<p>"A splendid show, Peter," he said.</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>"Manville ought to be proud."</p>

<p>"She had."</p>

<p>"Miss Wallace made a great hit, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Say, wa'n't she great!" replied Peter, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"She was, and her costume&mdash;" Mr. Blake
continued, but Peter interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Beat 'em all," he said.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that some of the stiff-backs are
offended," remarked Mr. Blake, after a pause.</p>

<p>"What if they be?" asked Peter, indignantly.
Just then Doctor Jones came in. "Mornin',
doctor."</p>

<p>"Good morning," the doctor cheerfully replied.</p>

<p>"Did you go to the show last night, doctor?"
asked Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got there just in time to see Miss Wallace."</p>

<p>"Like her?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor, slowly, "I have always
liked her, but now I think she's immense. Send
our order up early, will you, Peter?" And then
he hurried out of the store, bumping into Sam
Billings, who was coming in.</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc," said Sam, familiarly, "what
you got to say about the show?" The doctor, not
caring to listen to a long argument, continued
on his way without replying.</p>

<p>"Didn't that show beat all creation?" was
Sam's greeting as he entered the store after his
encounter with the doctor. "And did you notice
the crowd? They can say all they're a mind to
'gainst advertisin', but I say it pays. That hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
wouldn't have been half-full if I hadn't taken
hold."</p>

<p>Alick Purbeck came in from the back room in
time to hear enough of what Sam said to know
what he was blowing about.</p>

<p>"Say, Sam, can't you tell us now who put you
up to that advertisin' scheme?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I dunno's that's any of your business," replied
Sam, sulkily.</p>

<p>"No, it ain't," said Alick, "but I happen to
know that it kicked up a row in the church and
the woman's club, and folks do say that it
was Miss Sawyer that put the idea into your
head."</p>

<p>"Well," drawled Sam, "I won't deny that she
<i>said</i> somethin', but she didn't <i>do</i> nothin'. I'm
the only one responsible."</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," said Alick, knowingly.
"I knew you'd been hangin' round her some this
winter."</p>

<p>"Yes, you most always know everything that's
goin' on," retorted Sam. "Back doors can't
keep their mouths shut."</p>

<p>Alick resented this remark, and the resentment
was in the form of a rotten apple which struck
the offender full in the mouth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quit that foolin'," growled Peter, in time to
prevent trouble.</p>

<p>At that moment Ezra Tweedie slunk into the
store, casting glances of fear behind at every step
as though some dreadful monster was on his trail.
He shut the door carefully, then went to the stove,
held out his hands to be warmed, shivered, and
sighed. His face was drawn and white, and the
telltale circles beneath his eyes told of a sleepless
night.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Ezra," said Peter, cordially.</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen," replied Ezra,
in a weak voice, as he glanced furtively about.</p>

<p>"You're not feeling well, Mr. Tweedie?" inquired
Mr. Blake, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ezra, "I&mdash;I'm slightly indisposed,
but nothing serious&mdash;nothing serious."</p>

<p>"And how is Mrs. Tweedie after all the work
she has done?" Mr. Blake continued. Ezra
shuddered and coughed.</p>

<p>"She is&mdash;a&mdash;somewhat nervous," he replied,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," blurted Sam, "but I guess
she's kinder tickled over the big hit the show
made, ain't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, but&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Ezra was spared by the entrance of Deacon
Walton, whose opinion at that moment was more
to be desired than anything that Ezra, in his
sorry condition, might say.</p>

<p>Urged by Mr. Flint, the deacon had advised
his wife to resign from the club, which she had
done, but when the day of the performance came
neither the deacon nor his wife could resist the
temptation to attend and see what it was like.
Their presence caused surprise, but they seemed
to enjoy themselves, and many thought that perhaps
Mr. Flint had weakened, and had taken that
method of showing it. Those present at the store
that morning felt that an explanation was due, and
Sam proceeded to "pump."</p>

<p>"How'd you like the show, deacon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well," the deacon began, as he drew off his
mittens and rubbed his hands, "most of it was
good, but there was one young woman&mdash;" the
deacon paused and pointed a long bony finger at
Mr. Blake. Peter dropped his work to listen.
"One young woman," the deacon repeated, "who
was&mdash;er&mdash;indiscreet in her&mdash;er&mdash;what she
wore."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, during which
Ezra seemed to shrivel up within his overcoat.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean Miss Wallace, I suppose?" said
Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"I do. The morals of the people of Manville
have been shocked," replied the deacon, solemnly.</p>

<p>"You mean them that's got morals," corrected
Sam.</p>

<p>"I mean," retorted the deacon, angrily, "those
who are worth considering."</p>

<p>Mr. Blake loved an argument, and being the only
one present up to the deacon's mental calibre,
he naturally was the one to make reply.</p>

<p>"I think that you are mistaken there, deacon,"
he said, quietly. "Here's Peter, he saw the
performance, so did I, we were not shocked."</p>

<p>The deacon's face reddened.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I meant&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;church people,"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes, so I supposed," said Mr. Blake, "but
there are people outside of the churches who have
morals&mdash;morals capable of being shocked, too."</p>

<p>"I'll say just this much," replied the deacon.
"That young woman did a dangerous thing.
She has displeased many of our citizens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And their wives," interposed Sam, but the
deacon ignored the remark and continued:</p>

<p>"We cannot have such performances. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
young people will be corrupted, the moral tone of
our town will fall to the level of the dust. Such
a thing has never occurred before, and I sincerely
trust never will again, notwithstanding the approbation
of a few men who seem to have nothing
else to talk about."</p>

<p>"There, deacon," said Mr. Blake, soothingly.
"There's no use getting angry about it. Miss
Wallace's costume was the same as thousands of
other women have worn in public."</p>

<p>"That don't make it right," snapped the
deacon.</p>

<p>"Nor wrong," retorted Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"We'll see," said the deacon, as he drew on his
mittens and started for the door. "We'll see
when the school committee meets to-night what
<i>they</i> think about it." There was a triumphant
gleam in the deacon's eyes when he fired that shot,
and while his audience was still in a stunned
condition from the effect of it he went out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning after, Mrs. Tweedie was still
determined on her course, and Fanny's continued
pleading did not move her. Barbara must go,
and the angry, narrow-minded woman told her so
and gave her reasons immediately after breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Barbara had expected to be insulted again, but
to be turned out on such short notice was incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"You must go to-day," were Mrs. Tweedie's
parting words as Barbara started for school.
"To-day," Barbara repeated to herself as she went
down the steps. On her way she wondered if it
was really as bad as Mrs. Tweedie had said.
What were others thinking and saying? Her
duties that day were performed mechanically.
Her heart was not in the work, and she was glad
when school was over, though there was a perplexing
task to be accomplished before the day
was done.</p>

<p>Fanny called for her late in the afternoon, and
they started toward home together.</p>

<p>"I've got all of your things together, Barbara,"
said Fanny, trying to speak cheerfully. "I
thought&mdash;mother, you know&mdash;" Poor Fanny!
it was impossible to explain, or smooth over her
mother's conduct, and she burst into tears. Barbara
understood, and instead of being comforted
turned comforter herself.</p>

<p>"I know that you are my friend, Fanny," she
said, as she linked arms with the sobbing girl.</p>

<p>"I am, indeed I am," sobbed Fanny. "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
care what they say, and I want to help you." She
did not tell Barbara that she had spent hours that
day in a fruitless search for a boarding-place for
her.</p>

<p>"There," said Barbara, when they nearly had
reached Mrs. Tweedie's, "don't feel badly any
longer. I'll send for my things as soon as I find
a place to stay. And don't worry, Fanny, about
me, please, everything will come right I know."
Fanny kissed her, regardless of whoever might
be looking, and went home. Barbara hesitated a
moment, and then walked toward the home of
Doctor Jones. When Mrs. Jones came to the
door in response to the bell she did not ask Barbara
to come in.</p>

<p>"Really," she replied when Barbara made
known her errand, "there's not a spare room in
the house."</p>

<p>Of course Barbara understood, and was very
sorry. She next called on Mrs. Blake, and received
the same answer. Mrs. Thornton, Mrs.
Darling, and Mrs. Browning all refused. No, they
did not refuse, they made excuses&mdash;sugar-coated
lies. Barbara was beginning to understand that
Mrs. Tweedie was not the only one who had
turned against her. Darkness had fallen without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as well as within. Trying to realize her position,
Barbara walked slowly back toward the village.
When near the parsonage she stopped, and looked
up wistfully at the house and the stream of yellow
light that shone down the path from a lamp in the
parson's study. Then she looked across the street
toward the church so black and still with the
steeple rising toward the stars. Barbara hoped
that in the parsonage she would find a friend with
a kind word. She longed to run into the house
and pour out the wretchedness in her aching
heart to <i>his</i> mother; to talk of <i>him</i>, the one they
both loved. Oh, how happy she could be under
the roof that had sheltered <i>him</i>! She went to the
door and knocked. Mrs. Flint came, but her
answer was the same as the others, except that
there were tears in her eyes when she bade Barbara
good night. Mrs. Flint would have taken Barbara
into her home and heart if she had dared, but her
husband had paced his study floor all day, and
was in a terrible mood. Once she had listened
for a moment and heard him mutter: "The
disgrace," and "My son&mdash;my son cares for such
a woman!" He too had guessed Will's secret,
and she knew that Barbara would not be welcome.</p>

<p>When Barbara left the parsonage she walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
aimlessly about the village for an hour. The
wind came up blustering and cold; she began to
feel faint, but could think of no other place to go.
At last weariness overcame her, and hardly knowing
where she was, she stopped and leaned against
a gate-post to rest. Then a strange feeling came
over her, she tried to resist it and turned to walk
on, but staggered for a moment, and then fell.</p>

<p>After supper Mrs. Stout had gone into a neighbour's
for a moment, and when she came scurrying
back with a shawl drawn tightly over her head
and shoulders, she tripped and almost fell over
Barbara, who was lying in her gateway.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she exclaimed, as she recovered
her balance, and then knelt to see who it was.
"If it ain't Miss Wallace!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Barbara murmured, as Mrs. Stout
helped her to stand and led her into the
house.</p>

<p>"You poor child," said Mrs. Stout, as she
bustled about making Barbara comfortable on a
couch before the sitting-room fire.</p>

<p>"I had walked a long way and was faint,"
murmured Barbara, trying to explain.</p>

<p>"You ain't had any supper?" asked Mrs.
Stout, in surprise. Barbara smiled faintly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
shook her head. "Haven't you been to Mis'
Tweedie's since school?"</p>

<p>"I'm not staying there now," replied Barbara
as she turned her face away and shuddered.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" Mrs. Stout was beginning
to grasp the situation, and her surprise turned
quickly to indignation. "She's put you out,
that's what she's done, the mean old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Barbara, quickly, fearing that
Fanny would be included in Mrs. Stout's wrath.
"She told me this morning&mdash;I tried to find a
place&mdash;I had plenty of time, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nobody'd take you in," interrupted Mrs.
Stout. "They was afraid they'd soil their goody-goody
hands, I s'pose."</p>

<p>Barbara started to speak, then checked herself
and covered her face with her hands. "No, you
needn't say a word," Mrs. Stout continued, "I
know what's been goin' on in this town to-day,
and somebody besides you has got to suffer for
it. Now you just lie there and I'll get you somethin'
to eat." Mrs. Stout went to the kitchen,
and, after an absence of a few minutes, returned
with a tempting lunch and a cup of hot tea. Barbara
tried to eat, but failed despite Mrs. Stout's
kindly intended urging, and dropped back wearily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on the couch. When Mrs. Stout started to remove
the tray Barbara looked up at her appealingly.</p>

<p>"You'll let me stay to-night, won't you?"
she said, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>"Stay, I guess you can if I have to make up a
bed for Peter on the floor. Stay just as long as
you can stand us," replied Mrs. Stout, earnestly.
At that moment they heard Peter come in.</p>

<p>"Emmy," he called as he was taking off his
coat in the hall.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"What do you s'pose that damned school
committee done to-night?"</p>

<p>Barbara half-raised herself, her face was pale,
and the tears glistened on her eyelashes. Mrs.
Stout hurried to head Peter off, but was too
late.</p>

<p>"They've discharged Miss Wallace, and&mdash;"
he stopped abruptly when he came into the room
and saw Barbara.</p>

<p>"Discharged!" repeated Barbara as though
bewildered, and then she completely lost control
of herself, and wept bitterly. Mrs. Stout knelt by
her side, and tried to reassure and comfort her,
but it was past midnight when Barbara ceased to
moan, and asked if she could write a letter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Stout led the trembling girl to a desk, and
assured her that Peter would mail the letter, if she
wished him to, early the next morning.</p>

<p>Barbara wrote one line:</p>

<div class='blockquot2'><p>"Will, I need you, come.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Sermon</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the Sunday morning following the Morning
Glory Club's entertainment, the Rev. Elijah Flint
arose after a restless night feeling physically
miserable; but thoughts of the mighty effort that
he was to make that day caused him soon to
forget his bodily condition. Mrs. Flint had gone
out of town the day before to visit friends. The
minister was alone in the parsonage&mdash;alone with
a narrow, stubborn idea. After a meagre breakfast
of his own getting, he started early for
church, eager and impatient for the service to
begin.</p>

<p>A rumour had spread about town that Mr. Flint
was to depart from his usual custom on that day
and preach an up-to-date sermon. Everybody
knew what that meant, and everybody&mdash;almost&mdash;went
to church. When Mr. Flint went into
the pulpit, and turned the leaves of the large Bible
in search of the morning lesson, he glanced over
the large congregation with the keenest satisfaction.
It never occurred to him that the addition to his
small flock was made up of victims of morbid
curiosity. The idea crept into his mind that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
opposition to a recent "ungodly performance"
had brought favour to him and his church, which
before had been denied them. At last, he thought,
after years of unrewarded, unappreciated labour,
the tide has turned. Poor fool; if "narrowness"
and "curiosity" had been painted all over his
church in letters as tall as himself, God could not
have grieved more.</p>

<p>When Mr. Flint arose to deliver his sermon
the stillness of a tomb fell over devout and curious
alike, and was preserved to the end. The sermon
was a general denunciation of the stage, professional
and amateur, the latter being especially
stigmatized. And in reference to a recent local
performance, and the enormity of the sin of an
unnamed young woman who wore in public an
undescribed costume, the preacher was unscathingly
bitter and quoted these words: "As a
jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
which is without discretion." Thus, for an hour,
the man raved like one insane, and during that
time many of his hearers became infected with the
same malady. They believed every idea that was
hurled at them, swallowed words whole without
tasting to discover whether they were sweet or
poison. The accuser's vehemence surprised some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and grieved others, but none of the curious were
disappointed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Barbara sat at one of Mrs. Stout's front windows,
thoughtful and silent, as she watched the people
going home from church. Without, the sun was
shining brightly; within, the leaden cloud still
hung over her and grew darker without her knowing
it. The last cruel blow could not be anticipated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout had been motherly kindness itself.
She had tried in every way to lessen the sting of
the outrage&mdash;to make Barbara forget; but the
rough, good-hearted woman failed, though her
efforts were gratefully appreciated. She had
urged Barbara to go home, well knowing that
Manville must be unbearable, but Barbara was
waiting for Will. He had telegraphed that he
would come as soon as possible, but two days had
gone by since then. Oh, how she longed to see
him! He was the only one who could comfort and
help, and though she did not know how that even
he could silence the mischievous and careless
tongues, she had faith to believe that he would.</p>

<p>Have I done wrong? She asked herself a thousand
times, and each time the answer was "no."
Would Will think that she had sinned? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
thought was torture, but Love and Faith answered
the question for her.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Fanny Tweedie called, and
a few minutes afterward Mrs. Stout excused herself,
and went out wearing a sterner and more
determined look than her usually jovial countenance
was accustomed to. Fanny and Barbara
talked girl-fashion for an hour. There was some
laughter, and many tears, but both felt better for
it, and the seal of their friendship was made secure.
Fanny had brought a verbal message from her
father that pleased Barbara, and cheered her
greatly. Poor Ezra, he had been fond of her always,
and now that she was in such dire need of friends
he longed to help her, but Mrs. T. stood between
him and everything&mdash;a human, female barrier.</p>

<p>"Is he coming?" Fanny asked, after a long
pause in the conversation.</p>

<p>"Will?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, there's no other <i>he</i>, is there?"</p>

<p>"I have written him to come," Barbara replied.</p>

<p>"Does he know what has&mdash;happened?" said
Fanny. Barbara shook her head. Will did not
know exactly what had happened, but he was sure
that something had gone wrong, and at that
moment was speeding toward her in response to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
her tear-stained appeal. "Well," continued Fanny,
"I'm sorry for some folks when he does find out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout would not go to Mr. Flint's church
out of curiosity, or for any other reason, but she
had heard a true report of that morning's sermon,
and was filled to the bursting point with anger.
She thought it best to keep the news from Barbara,
however, and cautioned Fanny not to mention it.
But a vent for her feelings she must find, and it
was for that purpose that she had gone out. She
had no definite plan in mind, but almost unconsciously
walked toward the parsonage. Upon
reaching the gate she stopped. The house was
dark. How she hated it, and the man who lived
there. Sometime, possibly, she might forgive the
women who had refused to shelter Barbara, and
perhaps the school committee, but the minister
who had denounced her in the house of God she
could never forgive. With such thoughts in her
mind Mrs. Stout went up the path to the door and
rang the bell vigorously. It seemed a long time
before the door was finally opened by Mr. Flint,
who held the lamp high in order that he could
better see his visitor. Mrs. Stout noticed that his
face was flushed, and that his eyes were unnaturally
bright.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good evenin', Mr. Flint," she said, coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is Mrs. Stout?" he replied when he
heard her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks, I can say what I've got to right
here."</p>

<p>Mr. Flint placed the lamp on a table. His hand
trembled, and as he turned he staggered, but
caught and steadied himself by grasping the door-knob.</p>

<p>"I've come," Mrs. Stout began, "to say somethin'
that won't do any good, prob'ly, but I want
to be sure that you don't think that everybody in
Manville has got the same ideas as you about some
things in pertic'ler."</p>

<p>"I have never entertained that idea," replied
the parson.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but you might have." Mrs.
Stout hesitated for a moment, and then her anger
broke forth. "Mr. Flint, you made a big mistake
this mornin'. You said everything that you could
say to spoil the good name of one of the best
women that ever lived. She never did you, or
anybody else, any harm, but you and all the rest
seem bound to drive her away with as black a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
name as you can give her. The women folks
wa'n't satisfied with kickin' her out of their houses,
they must get the school committee to discharge
her. And then you, a man that is s'posed to show
folks how to live right, and believe in God, spend
a whole Sunday mornin' runnin' her down."
Mrs. Stout stopped because she was out of
breath.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Stout," the parson replied,
"it is not the woman that I am opposed to, but the
principles involved and violated, the morals
offended and endangered. Those susceptible
to corruption who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Corruption!" snapped Mrs. Stout. "Do you
mean to say that she could corrupt anybody in
any costume?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;minds of the
young&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The young, yes; but how about all those
women, most of 'em belonged to your church
too, that wore such corruption clothes when
they all had bicycles, and the fever was at its
worst?"</p>

<p>"Exercise, Mrs. Stout, excuses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exercise fiddlesticks! You've got the wrong
idea, Mr. Flint, and for that reason I s'pose you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
done more'n anybody else to disgrace a good
woman&mdash;the one that your son cares more about
than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the parson, feebly, as he raised
his hand protestingly.</p>

<p>"I will stop, because I ain't sure about that.
But I must say this much, that I hope you'll live
long enough to repent, though from what I've
heard, and know about you, you'll have to live
to be a hundred. Good night." Mrs. Stout
turned as abruptly as she had spoken, walked
down the path and up the road toward the home
of Mr. George, the chairman of the school committee.
Mr. Flint closed the door, returned to his
study, and sank wearily into a chair. Sick though
he was, Mrs. Stout had made him realize that
there was another side to the question, and he
asked himself repeatedly, as Barbara had been
doing, have I done wrong? And the answer was
the same. No; he had performed his duty as he
saw it&mdash;man can do no more than that and
serve God. But the view-point, there is always
more than one, and then his mind wandered to
the women on the bicycles.</p>

<p>Mr. George was at home when Mrs. Stout
called, and was delighted to see her. He asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
her to come in, and she accepted the invitation.
She afterward explained, when relating the story
to Peter, that "I wouldn't have gone in only I had
so much to say, and Mr. George is so bald I didn't
want him to catch cold and die, and then be
called a murderer by his wife."</p>

<p>"Rather unusual to see you on a Sunday
evening," said Mr. George, cheerfully, when Mrs.
Stout was comfortably seated.</p>

<p>"It's an unusual case," she replied, stiffly.</p>

<p>Mr. George raised his eyebrows, and then
frowned.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he replied, a little perplexed.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that the school committee
was in an awful big hurry about dischargin' Miss
Wallace?" asked Mrs. Stout, coming to the
point at once.</p>

<p>"Hem&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't, who does?"</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;er&mdash;well, of course I understand the
case, if that is what you mean. I assure you that
it was gone over very thoroughly."</p>

<p>"There ain't any doubt about that," replied
Mrs. Stout, with sarcasm. "It's been gone over
too thoroughly by everybody. Now what I want
to know is, if Miss Wallace tried to get another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
place somewhere else she'd have to tell where
she'd been before, wouldn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And they'd write to you, wouldn't they, about
what kind of a woman she was, and so forth?"</p>

<p>"It is customary."</p>

<p>"And you'd write back, and tell 'em exactly
how she happened to leave Manville, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"I should consider it my duty to state the
truth." Mr. George was getting uneasy.</p>

<p>"And she wouldn't get the place."</p>

<p>"Hem&mdash;probably not."</p>

<p>"Pretty hard for a woman that's got to earn
a livin'. It ain't too late for the school committee
to take back what it's done, is it?" Mrs. Stout
continued earnestly.</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't do it. <i>Now</i> I'm comin' to what
I've got to say. You discharged Miss Wallace
without any good reason. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stout, I protest," interrupted Mr. George.
"There was a reason, and you know it as well as
I do. Her costume at your club's entertainment
was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be careful," warned Mrs. Stout.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is my custom," replied the committeeman,
testily, "to speak with caution of one woman to&mdash;another
woman."</p>

<p>"If you'd be as considerate when talkin' to
men about one woman in pertic'ler there wouldn't
have been any need of my comin' here to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;hem&mdash;well, as I was about to say,
she was&mdash;er&mdash;indiscreet," stammered Mr.
George.</p>

<p>"That's what they all say," said Mrs. Stout,
scornfully. "I s'pose it would have been all
right if she'd worn a bathin'-suit. If Miss Wallace
was indiscreet, what would you call your two girls
when they went in bathin' down to Horse Shoe
Beach last summer at the Sunday-school picnic
before half the folks in Manville? Miss Wallace's
costume wa'n't half as indiscreet as a wet bathin'
suit is."</p>

<p>"Custom, Mrs. Stout, excuses many things,"
replied Mr. George, his face very red.</p>

<p>"Custom is often a mean excuse for not doin'
right," retorted Mrs. Stout. "Because it's been
the custom since the year one for men to get drunk,
and women's tongues to wag about other folkses
business, does that make it right?"</p>

<p>Mr. George was silenced&mdash;completely out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
action, and sat staring at his inquisitor, wondering
what would come next.</p>

<p>"Mr. George," Mrs. Stout continued, "I'm
goin' into politics next fall. The law of this State
only lets a woman vote for school committee, but
in this case that's enough. That's all I've got to
say, I guess, just now. If you should make up
your mind to take Miss Wallace back I wish you'd
let me know." With a glance of contempt at the
man before her, Mrs. Stout left her chair, and
started for the door. Mr. George followed,
mechanically opened the door, and when she had
gone out, closed it softly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stout felt relieved, but not satisfied, after
the two calls that she had made, and as she walked
slowly homeward, planned the campaign that was
to defeat Mr. George and his colleagues at the
next election. But her dreams of political victory
were quickly dispelled when she reached home.
Barbara and Fanny were in tears.</p>

<p>"Well, well, what's happened now?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I told her about the sermon," sobbed
Fanny. "But I didn't intend to, really I didn't,
Mrs. Stout."</p>

<p>"Well, she'd better hear it from her friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
than somebody else," said Mrs. Stout, soothingly.
"Secrets never do any good, anyway."</p>

<p>"I ought to know it," said Barbara. "Oh,
what a wicked, wicked woman they think I am!"
she moaned.</p>

<p>"But you're not, indeed you're not," cried
Fanny as she impulsively threw her arms about
Barbara and kissed her.</p>

<p>"There, there," said Mrs. Stout, "cryin' won't
help&mdash;hark!" Some one ran up the steps, and
set the door-bell to jingling furiously.</p>

<p>"Goodness! who can that be?" exclaimed
Mrs. Stout, as she started for the door. Barbara
sprang to her feet. Her hair was disarranged, her
cheeks were wet with tears, there was a look of
longing in her eyes, and on her lips trembled a
smile.</p>

<p>"Why, Willie Flint!" they heard Mrs. Stout
exclaim. Barbara did not move, but Fanny tiptoed
from the room. There was a heavy step in
the hall. At the sound Barbara took a step forward.</p>

<p>"Will, Will!" she cried, as he came into the
room.</p>

<p>In a moment his arms were about her, and then
some one closed the door softly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did I do wrong, Will?" Barbara asked an
hour later when she had finished the story of the
past week, omitting only the miserable part that
his father had played.</p>

<p>"No, Barbara," he replied, and she was
satisfied. But Will was not satisfied. He had
walked up from the station with some one who
had told him of his father's sermon, not knowing
that Barbara was more to him than an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"And father, what has he done?" he asked,
gravely.</p>

<p>Barbara looked up quickly, started to reply,
but Will continued before the words came.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> know what he did to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Barbara, faintly, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And mother, have you seen her?" (What
would she not have given to spare him that?)
"Why did you not go to her?" Will was determined
to know all.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I did," Barbara faltered.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Will, dear, please don't ask me. I'm sure that
she would have helped me if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She refused to take you in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Will, don't judge them, please. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sure that your father thought he was doing right
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet he preaches of Christ."</p>

<p>"Will!"</p>

<p>"God seems to have forgotten Manville," he
said, bitterly.</p>

<p>"No, Will, he is only showing us the way&mdash;and
the others too."</p>

<p>"How can you say that, Barbara, when they've
taken everything from you, position, name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything but you, Will," she interposed,
lovingly. It was growing late, the lamp was
burning low and sputtering. Mrs. Stout knocked
at the door, and to Will's response came into the
room.</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>," she said, "but I forgot to fill
that lamp to-day, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Mrs. Stout," Will laughingly interrupted,
"I understand, I'm going in a moment."</p>

<p>"'Deed you ain't goin' a step," replied Mrs.
Stout, determinedly. "I've got a room all fixed
for you, and I don't want to hear one identical
word about <i>not</i> stayin'."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Stout went for another lamp, there
was time for Barbara to give Will the answer that
he had striven for&mdash;and won.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>An Angel of Mercy</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning Will started for the
parsonage. On the way he wondered if misunderstanding
and contention would stand between
him and his father now, as it had in the past,
even though a woman's name was in the balance.</p>

<p>On arriving at the house and attempting to open
the door, Will discovered that he did not have his
keys with him. He rang the bell, but no one
answered. A second and a third ring in rapid
succession proved equally unsuccessful. Then
he went to the back door and knocked heavily&mdash;still
no response. On the way back to the front
door he looked in at a window, but could see no
one. Will was surprised and disappointed. He
knew of his mother's absence, but could not
understand why his father was not there at that
time in the morning. He gave the front door-bell
a final ring, waited several minutes, and then
started off toward the home of school committeeman
George.</p>

<p>As he was passing Stout's Grocery, Sam Billings,
who was standing in the doorway, waved his hand
and called:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Billy."</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam," Will replied without stopping.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be 'round here 'fore long.
Lively times," Sam shouted, but Will made no
reply. He met many friends and acquaintances
that day who looked curiously at him as he greeted
them and hastened by. He had no inclination
for idle talk, nor time; there being so much
serious work to be done, and only a day for its
accomplishment, as it was necessary for him to
return to the city that night.</p>

<p>When Will walked into Mr. George's office
that morning, that gentleman had not fully recovered
from the effects of Mrs. Stout's visit of
the night before. And when Will had concluded
his remarks he felt about as mean and frightened
as a narrow-minded man can feel.</p>

<p>Will called next on the other members of the
school committee, the editor of the local paper,
in which much had been insinuated concerning
Barbara, and the deacons of his father's church.
At noon he returned to Mrs. Stout's, and when
Barbara asked him where he had been, smilingly
replied, "Calling on our friends."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Will gave his time and attention
to the prominent ladies of the town,&mdash;Mrs. Tweedie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Darling, and
several others. He was extremely courteous to
the ladies, but when he had finished, many of
them knew what he would have said, and how he
would have said it, if they had happened to be
men.</p>

<p>Toward night, when on his way back to Mrs.
Stout's, Will stopped again at the parsonage, and
found it, as in the morning, apparently deserted,
and concluded that his father had gone away for
the day, perhaps to join his mother.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Stout as she opened the
door for him, "feel any better?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I doubt if I've done Barbara any
good," he replied.</p>

<p>"It's satisfyin', though, to tell folks what you
think of 'em," chuckled Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>Will laughed, and went to meet Barbara.</p>

<p>"Been scolding all the afternoon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>Will named the ladies on whom he had called.
Mrs. Stout was greatly pleased, especially when he
spoke of Mrs. Tweedie, but Barbara looked grave.</p>

<p>"What did you say to them, Will?" she asked
when he had finished.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something that they will never forget," he
replied.</p>

<p>"And what did they say to you?" asked Mrs.
Stout, curiously.</p>

<p>"Everything except the right thing."</p>

<p>"Made all kinds of excuses, I s'pose, but just
wait till the next meetin' of the club; if I don't
make a speech that'll make 'em feel like a piece of
worn-out carpet, it'll be because I'm struck dumb
before I get a chance," said Mrs. Stout, vigorously,
and then started for the kitchen to get supper.</p>

<p>"Have you seen your father, Will?" Barbara
asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"No; but I have been to the house twice.
Perhaps it is best. I hope to be in a better mood
when I come down next week."</p>

<p>"When you do see him, please try to forget me,
just think of him, and speak to him as your
father."</p>

<p>"If you wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Will, because it is right&mdash;for your own
sake," she pleaded, and he promised.</p>

<p>Between supper and train-time there was an
opportunity for Barbara and Will to make again
the vows of lovers. They forgot the time, the
train&mdash;everything except each other; but, fortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Mrs. Stout did not, and when the time
came, warned them that further delay was out
of the question by coughing just outside the door,
with an effort that was ridiculous, and asking
them if they knew what time it was. Barbara,
who was to accompany Will to the railroad
station, ran to put on her things, and Will called
to Mrs. Stout to come in, which she did.</p>

<p>"I can't thank you enough for your kindness,"
said Will, grasping her hand. "If it hadn't been
for you, I don't know what Barbara would have
done."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, I guess somebody'd come along
if I hadn't," replied Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"But she had been to several somebodies."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see how I could have done any
different," said Mrs. Stout, modestly.</p>

<p>"Bless you for it, Mrs. Stout, I can never
forget."</p>

<p>"Bless you again, and again," added Barbara,
who came into the room at that moment, and
emphasized her blessing with a kiss on Mrs. Stout's
red, fat cheek. As they were going down the
steps, Will turned and called, "Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," came a yell from three lusty
young throats.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, boys," laughed Will, with a wave
of his hand to the three youngsters, who had
stolen unawares into the hall behind their mother.</p>

<p>"You scamps!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout, as
she shut the door, and "shooed" them back up-stairs.</p>

<p>For a moment Barbara and Will were silent.</p>

<p>It was a beautifully still night, the air was clear
and cold&mdash;just such a night as the one on which
the sleigh-ride accident had occurred, but so much
had happened since then that neither thought
of it.</p>

<p>"When are you going home, Barbara?" Will
asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Very soon, in a day or two, probably."</p>

<p>"And when&mdash;when shall we be&mdash;" Will
hesitated. "Married" is a difficult word to
speak sometimes, but it came after a moment, and
manfully.</p>

<p>"I am ready, Will, when you are," Barbara
replied. At that moment they heard the pounding
of a horse's hoofs, and the sound of sleigh-bells,
coming furiously toward them. They stopped to
listen, and as the sound came nearer, Will, thinking
that it was a runaway, started into the road,
but Barbara clung to his arm and held him back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Love is selfish sometimes, and has a right to be.
As the team rushed by, they saw that it was Doctor
Jones.</p>

<p>"A race&mdash;perhaps with death," said Will,
as they walked on. Barbara shuddered.</p>

<p>The train was late, and while waiting, Barbara
and Will slowly paced the dimly lighted platform.
When at last the warning shriek of the engine
on the approaching train came through the still
night air, they stopped in their walk, and with
clasped hands watched the glaring headlight as
it rapidly neared them. The station-master,
lantern in hand, emerged from his warm office
and shivered when he felt the cold air, but
he did not see the man and woman who stood
near.</p>

<p>"Have courage," said Will, as the train stopped.</p>

<p>"And faith," Barbara whispered, as he turned
to leave her. A moment more and he was gone.
She watched until the red lights on the rear of the
train had disappeared, then slowly walked toward
Mrs. Stout's. In returning she went by a different
road, one that would take her by the parsonage.
The way was lonely, but she did not notice, and
deserted until she approached the home of Mr.
Flint, with the black church looming across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
way. A horse and sleigh were standing by the
side of the road, and near the gate two men, one
with a red lantern, were talking earnestly. As
Barbara drew nearer she saw that the red light
had been improvised by tying a red handkerchief
around an ordinary lantern, and recognized the
men by their voices as Doctor Jones and Sam
Billings.</p>

<p>"I can't find a man or a woman who will come,"
she heard the doctor say.</p>

<p>"He's a mighty sick man, and&mdash;" said Sam,
but Barbara interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Who?" she asked. The two men had not
heard her approach, and when she spoke they
were startled and instinctively stepped back. Barbara
misunderstood their action, and a feeling of
bitter resentment arose within her, as she started
to hasten by.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it Miss Wallace?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes," Barbara replied.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Wallace," said the
doctor, quickly, "it is not you of whom we are
afraid, but Mr. Flint is dangerously ill, and has
been lying in his study unattended since yesterday;
Sam, here, made the discovery to-night. Mrs.
Flint is away. I sent for her, but received word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that she is sick too, and I can't find any one to
take care of him. Has Will gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but what is the&mdash;what is Mr. Flint's
trouble?" Barbara asked, and looked wonderingly
at the red lantern.</p>

<p>The doctor knew that Barbara's courage was
good, he remembered how fearlessly she had
worked during the epidemic of diphtheria, early
in the winter, yet he hesitated now before answering
her question.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell me?" said Barbara,
impatiently. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Smallpox," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>It was Barbara's turn to shrink from them.</p>

<p>"And no one to nurse him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No; and that is what he needs more than
anything else," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"There must be some one&mdash;are they
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"But if you cannot get some one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His chance for life is nothing."</p>

<p>"He must not lie there alone and suffer!"
Barbara cried, as the horror of the situation became
more deeply impressed on her mind. The
three were silent for a moment. Each was trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to think of some one who was competent, and
willing to do the work.</p>

<p>"I know who will do it," said Barbara, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who?" the doctor asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I will," Barbara calmly replied.</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed the doctor and Sam together.</p>

<p>"I must," she replied, firmly.</p>

<p>"But you have been worried, you are in no
condition to undertake such work," the doctor
pleaded. "Think of the risk, and the work, day
and night for days, perhaps weeks."</p>

<p>"Will it be any harder to bear than what I have
already borne?" she asked. The men were
silent. "Please send word to Mrs. Stout, and&mdash;I
will go in now." She turned to go, but stopped
when the doctor spoke.</p>

<p>"You may save him, but you will sacrifice
yourself. Why should you do that for the man
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, doctor, do not remind me of what he
has done&mdash;I have tried to forget."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the doctor, who saw that
she was determined. "Sam will be here outside
to get anything that you may need. I shall call
in the morning."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara walked up the path to the door of the
parsonage. The two men watched, and, accustomed
as the doctor was to scenes of suffering,
sacrifice and death, there were tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"She's an angel," muttered Sam.</p>

<p>"Courage, faith," was Barbara's whispered
prayer as she opened the door of the pest-stricken
house and went in.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Many Minds Change</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning the people of Manville had
something really new and startling to talk about.
When it first became known that Mr. Flint had
been stricken with that most dreaded and loathsome
disease, smallpox, everybody tried to remember
the most recent time that they had been near
him. Many who had attended his church on the
previous Sunday felt that they were doomed.
Others equally superstitious thought that they
and Mr. Flint were to be punished in this way by
a wrathful God for the persecution of an innocent
woman. All sorts of crazy, silly talk was indulged
in, but through it all Barbara's praises were sung,
though few seemed to understand fully why she
had sacrificed herself. Their minds were too
narrow, their world too small, to appreciate such
service.</p>

<p>The red flag by day, the lantern by night, and
Sam Billings all the time on the steps of the parsonage,
were objects of curious interest. Many
went far out of their way in order to pass by&mdash;on
the opposite side&mdash;and Sam was kept busy all
day yelling answers to volleys of questions. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he was equal to the task and enjoyed it. For the
time being he was the only person in town of any
consequence, the centre of all interest, the only
one to answer questions, and he was being paid
for it.</p>

<p>At Stout's Grocery, the proprietor, Alick Purbeck,
and undertaker Blake were loud and sincere
in their praise of Barbara.</p>

<p>"She's the right kind," said Alick, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"There's not a woman in town her equal,"
added Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>"Right," said Peter, "exceptin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, exceptin'&mdash;" Alick smiled.</p>

<p>"Excepting our own beloved," Mr. Blake
finished for them.</p>

<p>"What are the chances of the smallpox
spreadin', Mr. Blake?" asked Alick.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of an epidemic, the undertaker
unconsciously rubbed his hands together in
a businesslike manner.</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet," he replied. "I have no idea
where Mr. Flint got it. This part of the country
has been remarkably free from it this winter.
Perhaps there won't be another case."</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Alick. "If Mr. Flint gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
well, he'll have to take back some things that he's
said, won't he?"</p>

<p>"And some other folks, too," added Peter.</p>

<p>"They're beginning to change their minds,
already," Alick continued. "Half a dozen women
told me this mornin' that all this fuss has been
about somethin' that wa'n't half as bad as 'twas
made out to be; and I told 'em that some folks
did change their minds about as often as they
opened their mouths."</p>

<p>"Did you say that to customers?" asked
Peter, who always had an eye and ear to business;
but at that moment, Mr. George, the school
committeeman, came in, and temporarily saved
the talkative clerk from the censure that he justly
deserved.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Mr. George," said Alick, who was
grateful for his timely appearance. Peter grunted
some unintelligible greeting, while Mr. Blake
bowed stiffly and turned away. Alick wanted to
make Mr. George uncomfortable as soon as
possible, and came to the point at once, by asking,
"Hear the news?"</p>

<p>"News, what news?" queried Mr. George.</p>

<p>Alick was something of an actor, and to further
perplex the school committeeman, dropped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
measure of potatoes that he was holding, and
stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You ain't heard!" he gasped, after a pause of
appropriate length.</p>

<p>"If you've got anything to say&mdash;say it,"
snapped Mr. George, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flint&mdash;" Alick began, but Mr. George
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Not dead!" he exclaimed, as he turned toward
the undertaker, and a look of dread spread
over his face.</p>

<p>"No," replied Alick, slowly, "at least he
wa'n't the last I heard, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out with it, tell me!" demanded Mr. George.</p>

<p>"He's got the smallpox," said Alick, quietly.</p>

<p>Mr. George was wholly unprepared for the
shock. His nerves had been so seriously irritated
of late, that the distressing news concerning his
beloved pastor almost unmanned him. Without
giving his victim time to recover, Alick continued:
"But that ain't the best part of it."</p>

<p>"The best part of it!" repeated Mr. George,
in amazement. "What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Alick, gleefully, "that they
couldn't get anybody to take care of him until
Miss Barbara Wallace came along, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
being asked, took her life in her hands and stepped
in where nobody else <i>dared</i> to go."</p>

<p>If Alick had struck him in the face, Mr. George
could not have been more surprised. "You see,"
Alick went on, "there's <i>somethin' good</i> about her,
after all."</p>

<p>"No doubt&mdash;no doubt," coughed Mr. George,
in a dazed sort of way. "I must look into the
matter. Very commendable, certainly." With
that he backed out of the store.</p>

<p>"The old hard-shelled stiff-back," muttered
Alick, as he shook his fist in the direction of the
door.</p>

<p>"You've given him something to think about,"
said Mr. Blake.</p>

<p>As Mr. George walked toward the home of
Mr. Flint, he summed up his chances for re&euml;lection,
and found them very slim. When he arrived
at the parsonage, or, rather, the farthest point
from it to which he thought Sam Billings's voice
would carry, he stopped and gazed upon the
modest dwelling and its gaudy decoration. Sam
spied him, and hailed him gleefully. Mr. George
asked for details, and got them wonderfully
elaborated by Sam's imaginative mind.</p>

<p>When Sam had finished his story he began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
asking impertinent questions&mdash;questions that
made the school committee-man's conscience turn
somersaults as he walked quickly away. Later
in the day he drove about town, and notified the
members of the school committee that there would
be a special meeting that evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon there was an especially-special
meeting of the Morning Glory Club, at the home
of Mrs. Blake. The club-women knew that the
meeting had been called for the purpose of expelling
Barbara Wallace from the club, and to
take some action in regard to making public the
fact that the club was not in any way responsible
for the costume that she had worn in the theatricals,
and many other harsh and terrible, though
very indefinite things, but Barbara had unknowingly
frustrated their plans.</p>

<p>A moment after the members had been called
to order, a motion to adjourn was made and
carried, and then they settled themselves for a
delightful afternoon talking it over. Mrs. Tweedie
appeared to be deeply affected by Barbara's
brave act. "We may have misjudged Miss Wallace,"
she admitted, and then she talked about
"atonement" and many other things about which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
none of us know but little. She tried to explain
why she had turned Barbara out by admitting
that she was vexed at the time, and only had meant
that she expected her to find another boarding-place
as soon as possible. "Indeed, how could
I do otherwise in view of the unpleasant circumstances?
And when she did not return that night
at the usual time, no one could imagine my surprise."</p>

<p>"And I have no doubt," said Mrs. Jones, when
Mrs. Tweedie had said all that she could to put
herself on the right side, "not the slightest, but
that Miss Wallace misunderstood me. Of course,
I was not wholly in sympathy with her, but I
really would not have refused, had I a room to
spare." Mrs. Jones wiped away two tears which
opportunely came to her eyes, caused, however,
not by an excess of emotion, but by a cold in her
head.</p>

<p>"True," replied Mrs. Tweedie, "we all have
been cruelly misquoted, misunderstood, and misjudged."</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Tweedie; poor, unfortunate Morning
Glories. Now that Barbara must be vindicated,
they wanted to pose as martyrs themselves.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Flint&mdash;Will Flint I mean&mdash;call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
on any of you ladies yesterday?" asked Mrs.
Thornton, after all had explained, to their own
satisfaction, why they had treated Barbara as
they had.</p>

<p>An impressive silence followed. Mrs. Stout
snickered, despite her determination to hold her
peace until the others were talked out.</p>

<p>"Really," began Miss Sawyer, "I must confess
that he called on me." Upon that others admitted
that they, too, had been honoured.</p>

<p>"What did he say to you, Miss Sawyer?"
asked Mrs. Darling, eagerly.</p>

<p>"He said a great deal, and was very much in
earnest. He has changed greatly since I last&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed he has," interrupted Mrs. Thornton.
"He's quite good-looking now."</p>

<p>"And," continued Miss Sawyer, "he spoke of
the honour of a woman as being the most sacred
thing, and&mdash;oh, he said so much in such a short
time, and was so gentlemanly, that one could
forgive him for saying anything." Miss Sawyer
spoke rapidly, and when she had finished was
blushing crimson.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the ladies in chorus, and
then they laughed at Miss Sawyer's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"He <i>did</i> make an impression on you, Miss Sawyer,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
simpered Mrs. Darling. "And was he as
agreeable to you, Mrs. Tweedie?" the shallow
young matron asked, meaningly, as she smiled
on "the powerful." Mrs. Tweedie looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"The young man called," she replied, solemnly,
"but our conversation was of a confidential
nature."</p>

<p>No one ever knew just what Will did say to
Mrs. Tweedie, but some guessed that his remarks
to her were made more after the manner
of the "<i>other sex</i>" than they were to the other
women.</p>

<p>"I have heard," said Mrs. Blake, after a lull
in the conversation, "that he was very violent
with Mr. George."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," piped Mrs. Browning, "he struck
him, and threatened to shoot him if he didn't
have Miss Wallace reinstated."</p>

<p>"And I haven't a doubt but what he'd do it,"
said Mrs. Thornton.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they're really engaged. Has
anybody heard?" asked Mrs. Darling, who loved
the affairs of lovers almost as much as she loved
herself.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask one of 'em?" said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Stout, abruptly. "That's about the only thing
that any of you don't seem to be sure about."</p>

<p>Mrs. Darling's cheeks flushed slightly, but she
wisely refrained from replying. "Perhaps some
of you have noticed that I ain't said much to-day,"
continued Mrs. Stout, "and I want to tell you
that one reason is because I've learned a lesson
about talkin' too much from the woman that
you've been talkin' about. But there's one or
two things that I've just got to say. There's been
a lot said about bein' misunderstood, and such.
What was said about Miss Wallace was plain
enough when it was said. What was done&mdash;was
done; but there ain't one woman, not a
livin' one, that's said, or done, one thing to make
good the harm they've done her&mdash;except to stop
sayin' bad things. That's somethin', but it ain't
enough; now she's tryin' to save the life of the
man that did more than anybody else to take
away her good name, and riskin' her own life
doin' it. You all know better than you did before
what kind of a woman she is. Now, I ain't
goin' to say all of the hard things that I was goin'
to say, and wanted to say, but what I want to
know is, what are we, this club, goin' to do to
show her that we made a mistake and are sorry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and by doin' it show everybody that we ain't a
set of mean, narrow-minded women?"</p>

<p>"What would you suggest?" Mrs. Tweedie
calmly asked.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mrs. Stout, "we can never
pay her in any way for the wrong that's been done
her, but we can show her that we'd like to. I
move that we send a letter to the school committee,
and every mother's son of us sign it, askin' them
to give Miss Wallace back her school, and say
that we know her to be a woman with a character
as good as anybody's, and better than most
folks, and that we believe she's been in the right
in everything that she's said or done since we've
known her. If the motion don't go, it's more'n
likely that I shall forget my good resolution about
not sayin' things." Mrs. Stout sat down, utterly
out of breath, and mopped her face while a slight
murmur of surprise ran about the room. The
motion was seconded, and the question put without
debate.</p>

<p>"It is a unanimous vote," Mrs. Tweedie announced.
Mrs. Stout smiled. She well knew

about at the comically sad-faced women, "I
must say that you're the glumist lookin' lot of
mornin' glories I ever see."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Coals of Fire</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barbara's</span> new task as nurse and housekeeper
at the parsonage was not an easy one, but after
the second day she had everything in good order&mdash;everything
except her patient. For him there
was little hope&mdash;Barbara knew, and Mr. Flint
himself knew.</p>

<p>When the minister first saw her after he had
been lying alone for hours his only thought was
that she had come to demand something. He
had publicly denounced her; she had been
turned away from his door; what could she have
come for except revenge?</p>

<p>"I have come to take care of you, Mr. Flint,"
was all that she had said, but it was enough to
reassure him.</p>

<p>Barbara's work had taken her into all of the
rooms in the house in search of one thing or another.
The first day she had opened the door
of <i>his</i> room&mdash;Will's. She had only taken a step
when she discovered whose room it was, and knew
that what she was looking for would not be found
there. She could not resist the temptation, however,
to glance about the room. There were his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
books, and his fishing-rods and tackle; his shotgun
stood in a corner, and near a window was an
old-fashioned writing-table. It was a boy's room&mdash;<i>his</i>
room. Barbara feasted her eyes for a moment,
and then, remembering her patient, stepped
back into the hall, and softly closed the door.</p>

<p>Hanging on the wall, opposite the foot of
Mr. Flint's bed, in an oval frame of black walnut,
was a photograph of Will. The picture was a
likeness of a sturdy little chap of three, with large,
staring eyes, fat cheeks, and long curls. Barbara
looked at it often; Mr. Flint, too, often looked
at the picture, but only when Barbara was not in
the room,&mdash;while she was there his eyes followed
her constantly. There was something
about her, and what she was doing for him, that
he, in his condition, could not understand. They
talked but little. Once Mr. Flint began to speak
of his notorious sermon, but Barbara quickly
stopped him.</p>

<p>Sam Billings had been hired by the board of
health to maintain quarantine on the parsonage,
though the fear of the people of Manville made it
almost unnecessary except for the sake of appearances.
The weather was mild, and when not engaged
in a noisy conversation with some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
across the road, Sam sat on the steps, or paced
the path to the gate. Through Sam and Doctor
Jones was the only means Barbara had of communicating
with the world, but just then she had
little use for the world or many in it. Sam afforded
her some amusement, however, when she went
to the door for a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Miss Wallace," he said, one morning,
"folks have changed their minds about you."</p>

<p>"That is a right we all have," Barbara smilingly
replied.</p>

<p>"They all think that you're a heroine now."</p>

<p>"I am sure of one good friend in you, Mr.
Billings." The "Mr." pleased Sam greatly&mdash;it
was seldom used as a prefix to his name.</p>

<p>"You're jest right about that," Sam grinned.
He liked Barbara and her smile immensely.
When she had gone in and closed the door he
reflected that, if he were younger, and knew more,
and had a steady job, and Billy Flint was not in
love with her and she with him, why, he would
put <i>his</i> best foot forward.</p>

<p>"Has any word come from Will?" Mr. Flint
asked, on the afternoon of the second day.</p>

<p>"No," Barbara replied; "but I know that we
shall hear to-day."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick man turned restlessly.</p>

<p>"I must see him," he moaned; "there is something
that I must say to him, and to you&mdash;Barbara."
He hesitated before speaking her name&mdash;it
was the first time he had called her that.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Flint," remonstrated Barbara, in
alarm, "he cannot come here, he must not put
himself in danger; besides, there will be plenty
of time when you are well again."</p>

<p>"That time may not come. I must tell him
before it is too late."</p>

<p>"But not at the risk of his life. Is not his life
more to you&mdash;and to me&mdash;than our own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the feeble reply, and then he
muttered: "My miserable life."</p>

<p>"There," said Barbara, soothingly, "we have
talked more than is for your good." She started
to leave the room, but he held out his hand appealingly.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said. "If I cannot tell him I must
say it to you. I have guessed the secret, yours
and Will's. It was that more than anything else
that made me preach as I did. From childhood
to manhood I fear I have wronged him. I was
narrow&mdash;blind. I have wronged you, too, and
yet you came to save me. For Will's sake forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
me, Barbara, and if I never see him again tell him
that I lived to realize my sin, tell him that I have
suffered&mdash;" The minister stopped abruptly
and listened. There was a quick step in the hall
below. Barbara turned quickly toward the door,
and Mr. Flint dropped his outstretched hand.
Some one was running up the stairs. Barbara
half-guessed the truth and was transfixed with
horror.</p>

<p>"Will!" she screamed, as he appeared in the
doorway. "Don't come in&mdash;go quick&mdash;think
of the danger!"</p>

<p>Mr. Flint had half-raised himself, and was
staring at his son with a look of agony on his face.</p>

<p>"In God's name, Will, go! Your life&mdash;"</p>

<p>Will calmly raised his hand as though to command
silence.</p>

<p>"Danger, my life?" he said, and then smiled
as he took Barbara's hands in his own. "Your
life is my life, Barbara."</p>

<p>"And mine," groaned the sick man.</p>

<p>"Yes, and yours, father," replied Will, as he
went to the bed and looked into his father's eyes.
"I'm sorry to find you this way, but I have good
news of mother. She is better, except for worrying
about you and wanting to come." A sob from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Barbara caused Will to turn quickly and clasp
her in his arms, and as he wiped away the tears
and kissed her, he saw the worry and work written
on her face.</p>

<p>"I have come to help, Barbara," he said. She
understood and blessed him for it, but until all
danger was passed she prayed unceasingly for
his safety.</p>

<p>That evening Sam Billings was dozing on the
front steps when Will opened the door without
thinking that Sam was not aware of his presence
in the parsonage.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam," he said.</p>

<p>Sam was so startled that he almost fell down the
steps. When he had recovered his balance he
stood up, rubbed his eyes, and stared.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blamed if it ain't Billy Flint!"
he exclaimed. "How'd you get in?"</p>

<p>"By the back door; I knew that you would
make a fuss if I tried to get in this way."</p>

<p>"Ain't you takin' big chances?"</p>

<p>"I'd be taking bigger ones if I stayed away."</p>

<p>Sam mentally concluded that Will knew what
he was talking about, though he could not understand
it himself.</p>

<p>"What'll folks say?" he blurted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Will's face grew dark with anger.</p>

<p>"What will they say?" he asked, quickly.
"What do I care what they say? What can they
say that will be worse than what has been said?"</p>

<p>Sam backed down the steps. He had blundered,
and feared Will's wrath.</p>

<p>"Of course, I didn't mean&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Never mind," interrupted Will, "I have an
errand for you to do. Go to the town clerk, and
get a blank application for a marriage license."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a what?" gasped Sam.</p>

<p>"I'm not crazy, Sam," said Will, who was
much amused by Sam's astonishment. "Do as
I've asked, and when there is any news worth
telling you shall hear it first."</p>

<p>Sam started off without another word, and Will
returned to his father and Barbara.</p>

<p>When Sam made his errand known to Mr.
Wiggins, the town clerk, he was laughed at.</p>

<p>"No foolin' now," said Sam, impatiently. "I
want one of them applications, and I want it
quick."</p>

<p>"There you are," replied Mr. Wiggin, as he
handed Sam the desired blank. "Better fill it
out right here, Sam, and then I can give you the
license without any delay."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I guess I won't fill it out jest now,"
drawled Sam, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you ain't quite sure of the lady's
age."</p>

<p>"That's it, I ain't."</p>

<p>"I always thought that you'd get married
sometime, Sam."</p>

<p>Sam had been joked so often about matrimony
that it seldom annoyed him, and now that his inquisitor
was wholly on the wrong scent he was
greatly amused.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "most men do marry sooner
or later."</p>

<p>"And in your case it's a good deal later,"
chuckled Mr. Wiggins.</p>

<p>"Yes; but you see I've seen so many blamed
fools get married 'fore they'd cut all their second
teeth I've kinder hung off," Sam retorted.</p>

<p>"Miss Sawyer's a nice kind of woman," ventured
Mr. Wiggins, as he coughed, and looked
at a picture on the wall. The grin on Sam's face
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about her?" he demanded,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I said that she was a nice kind of a woman.
No harm in that, is there?" Mr. Wiggins mildly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
asked, as he turned his weak little eyes on Sam,
who did not dare to meet them with his own.</p>

<p>"No," grunted Sam, as he turned to go; "but
I must be goin'."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you," called Mr. Wiggins, as
Sam ran down the steps.</p>

<p>The town clerk and his wife had callers that
evening, and Mr. Wiggins, thinking that the joke
was too good to keep, told them of Sam's errand,
not forgetting to say that during their conversation
Miss Sawyer's name had been mentioned.</p>

<p>News germs spread faster and farther than any
other kind of bugs. The next afternoon Miss
Sawyer heard from reliable sources that she was
to be married to Mr. Samuel Billings a week from
Thursday at seven o'clock in the evening by the
Rev. Thomas Morton, of Uphill Centre, who had
married her father and mother forty years before.
She also heard that her wedding-gown was to be
of gray and white foulard silk, with lace trimmings,
and that her other things were just <i>lovely</i>. There
was more, but she fainted and missed it. Poor
Lizzie, it was cruel, terribly cruel.</p>

<p>When Sam returned to the parsonage Will was
at the door waiting for him.</p>

<p>"The old fool thought it was for me," said Sam.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your turn may come next," Will replied.
"Got a pencil?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then read the questions, and write the answers
as I give them." Sam obeyed, though with
difficulty, because his lantern flickered, and he
was not "much at writin' anyhow."</p>

<p>"Goin' to be married to-night, Billy?" asked
Sam, when the application had been filled
out.</p>

<p>"Never mind; go and get the license," replied
Will.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wiggins read the names on the
blank which Sam brought on his second visit,
he dropped the paper and jumped back with
horror. Sam laughed outright as he picked it
up and held it out to the fear-stricken man.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared," he said; "nobody in the
parsonage touched it. I wrote it myself just as
Billy Flint told me to."</p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins felt relieved and angry.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me who it was for?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"'Cause you jumped at the answer without
givin' me a chance," retorted Sam.</p>

<p>Without another word the town clerk made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
out the license, and when it was finished gave it
to Sam, who started quickly for the door.</p>

<p>"Next time," said Mr. Wiggins, stiffly, "you'll
save yourself trouble by not being so close-mouthed."</p>

<p>"And next time," replied Sam, "you'd better
not jump the creek till you get to it."</p>

<p>When Sam returned Will picked up the paper
that was placed on the top step, thanked him,
and turned to re&euml;nter the house.</p>

<p>"Say, Billy," said Sam, "what am I goin' to
say to folks when they ask me?"</p>

<p>"Tell them all that you know."</p>

<p>"And s'posin' they asked me if you was married?"</p>

<p>"Tell them that if they live long enough they'll
know sometime," replied Will, as he shut the
door, and ran lightly up the stairs to the sickroom.
Barbara met him at the door with her finger on
her lips cautioning silence.</p>

<p>"He's asleep," she said.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A Wedding and a Sermon</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> warm, bright sun of early April made the
Sabbath morning beautiful. Here and there
patches of dainty green could be seen, and in some
sheltered, sunny spots the daring bloom of the
crocus had thrust itself into view&mdash;purple, yellow,
and white.</p>

<p>On that day there was no happier home in the
world than the parsonage. Mr. Flint had fully
recovered; his wife had returned and was bustling
nervously about trying to make up for lost
time. Barbara and Will were there, and, in their
undemonstrative way, very happy.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful morning for all of us,"
said Mr. Flint, as he got up from the breakfast-table
and went to the window. "Spring has
come without&mdash;and within. Ah! if I had known,
if I had been awakened earlier in life&mdash;"</p>

<p>Barbara left her place at the table, ran quickly
to him, and gently placed her fingers on his lips.</p>

<p>"Remember, you promised," she said, smilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Barbara, but I expect to break my
promise many&mdash;many times. When a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
has been born again how can you expect him to be
silent? The world is all new to me, Barbara.
Try to imagine what I have lost in my narrow,
high-walled life. I must see everything; I must
babble like a child if I will. Yet you, Barbara,
modest girl that you are,&mdash;the one who saved my
body, and put peace into my soul,&mdash;demand that
I keep silence." Mr. Flint spoke in a half-serious,
half-humourous way, but they understood, and rejoiced
at the change in his manner&mdash;and the man.</p>

<p>Barbara and Mrs. Flint began clearing the
table, the minister retired to his study, while
Will paced the sitting-room, deep in thought.
When the door-bell rang a moment later Will
answered its summons. It was Mrs. Stout, out
of breath and flushed by her walk, but smiling.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Willie," she puffed.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Stout; come in."</p>

<p>"Ain't late, am I?" she asked, anxiously, as she
stepped into the hall and sat down in the nearest
chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"What a lovely mornin' to get married. Now
if 'twas me I'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come right in to the sitting-room," called
Mrs. Flint, from the kitchen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said Mrs. Stout, as she got up to
welcome Barbara, who came out to meet her. "I
just set down for a minute to ketch my breath.
Well, Barbara Wallace, if you ain't lookin' fine
for a woman that's been shut up in the house for
weeks." Then Mrs. Stout shook her finger at Will
and added: "Willie Flint, you're a lucky man."</p>

<p>"I know it, Mrs. Stout," laughed Will, as they
went into the sitting-room. Just then Mrs. Flint
appeared and shook hands cordially with Mrs.
Stout.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me for coming this way, apron
and all," she said, "but I was washing dishes,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good land! yes, Mis' Flint. My, but you're
lookin' better'n you have in years. And if here
ain't Mr. Flint himself!" exclaimed Mrs. Stout,
as the parson appeared in the doorway, and then
hastened toward her with outstretched hand.
"Mr. Flint," continued Mrs. Stout, as she shook
his hand vigorously, "I was never so glad to
see you before in all my life."</p>

<p>"And I can truly say the same of you, Mrs.
Stout," laughed the parson.</p>

<p>"Well, forgive and forget, says I," said Mrs.
Stout, quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Amen," replied Mr. Flint.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Flint, "I just
can't finish those dishes. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let 'em go," said Mrs. Stout; "nobody's
s'posed to wash dishes when there's a weddin'
comin' off in a few minutes, your own son's, too,
and the best, sweetest woman in the whole wide
world." And to prove that she meant every word
she put her arms around Barbara and kissed the
cheeks that grew pink with pleasure and modesty.</p>

<p>"And in you they have one of the best, truest
friends possible," Barbara replied.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mrs. Stout, who was modest
herself.</p>

<p>"No nonsense about it," Mr. Flint interposed,
earnestly. "If it had not been for you and your
kindness, where would we all be now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," replied Mrs. Stout, "you'd prob'ly
been alive just the same."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mrs. Stout, but what is life without sunshine
in our hearts? Barbara not only nursed
me back to life&mdash;she showed me how to live.
And you were her friend when all others failed,
you saved her for the task."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Mrs. Stout, resignedly, "I
done what I thought was best."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"And God bless you for it," replied the minister,
fervently. As he spoke the church-bell
rang out on the warm spring air. He turned to
Barbara and took her hand. "Barbara, dear,
we have but a few moments&mdash;where shall it
be?"</p>

<p>"Here," she said, "where the sun is brightest."</p>

<p>Barbara and Will, with clasped hands, stood
near a window where the morning light lit up
their bright young faces&mdash;faces filled with love
and hope. The simple service&mdash;a promise and
a prayer&mdash;was soon over. The tears were
streaming down Mrs. Flint's cheeks as she greeted
her son and his bride. Mrs. Stout's eyes, too,
were moist, though she would have denied it.
The church-bell was tolling. Mr. Flint had another
duty to perform, and was impatiently eager
to be about it.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "we must be going."</p>

<p>"Do give us time to get straightened out,"
replied Mrs. Stout. "Us women folks can't go
to a weddin' and then rush off to church in a
minute, can we, Mis' Flint?"</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Flint, she was so excited that, without
Mrs. Stout's assistance, she could not get her
bonnet on straight. In a few minutes they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
ready, however, and left the house together on
their way across the road to the church.</p>

<p>As Barbara and Will, followed by Mrs. Flint
and Mrs. Stout, walked up the aisle, every eye in
the crowded church was fixed upon them. Were
they married? No one knew. Sam Billings had
told all that he knew, according to Will's instructions,
but none were the wiser for all that.</p>

<p>That part of the service preceding the sermon
was rushed, and the minister as well as the congregation
assisted in the process. When the last
note of the hymn had died away, and the rustling
of the people sitting and making themselves comfortable
had ceased, Mr. Flint left his seat, advanced
quickly to the desk, and opened the large
Bible. He turned the pages for a moment, and
then looked up and repeated rather than read
from the Book of Proverbs: "Be not a witness
against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive
not with thy lips." Then he closed the book
and walked slowly to the front of the platform.</p>

<p>"Friends," he began, in a quiet tone, so unlike
his former manner that all wondered at it, "for
a time God saw fit to take me from you. It is
appropriate that at this season of the year, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
our part of the world is bursting forth into joyous,
beautiful life, that He should send back, not the
man you once knew, but another, one whose life
is beginning anew like nature." He continued at
length on the "new life" that had come to him.
Suddenly he paused, and when he spoke again
quoted these words: "A good name is to be chosen
rather than great riches." He moved about nervously
for a moment before continuing. "A few
weeks ago the innocent act of a good woman caused
her to be reviled, shunned, and turned away from
our doors. Of those who so harmed her I was
the chief offender. Every word, every act, was a
cruel thrust, the torture of which none of us can
wholly appreciate. And then she came when
disease&mdash;the most loathsome&mdash;had stricken me,
when all others shunned even the house in which
I lay, she came and brought me back to life.
And then&mdash;then she saved my soul!" The
minister's face was pale; he made no gestures;
he did not raise his voice; but his earnestness and
remorse were unmistakable. "And my son,"
he continued, "he whom I should have guided,
I have wronged by living a narrow, loveless life."
Thus, for an hour he talked about the "new life,"
love, and remorse. But his closing words interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
many of his congregation more than those
that had preceded them.</p>

<p>"The son whom I have wronged, and the
woman sent by God, have I this day made one,"
he said, and there was triumphant joy in his voice.</p>

<p>Barbara's friends&mdash;everybody was her friend
now&mdash;kept their places with difficulty during
the closing hymn and the benediction. As it was,
they failed to give Mr. Flint time for an appropriate
"Amen," before they rushed upon Barbara
and Will, and almost suffocated them with sweet
words.</p>

<p>When the last one had gone, Barbara, with the
good wishes of everybody ringing in her ears,
turned to Mr. Flint, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't deserve it, I&mdash;" she began, but
he gently interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Barbara, every word is true." And then
turning to Will asked, "Do you understand now,
Will?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," was the reply, and the two men
clasped hands.</p>

<p>"Barbara," said Mr. Flint, as they were walking
toward the door, "there is one word that I long
to hear you say, I must hear it, you must not deny
me any longer." Barbara stopped, she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
understand. "It is the one word from your lips
that will fill my cup of happiness to the brim,"
added the minister, feelingly. "Can't you guess?"</p>

<p>A light came into Barbara's eyes, and smiling
through her tears she said:</p>

<p>"Father."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Good Cheer&mdash;Good Will</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Success</span>, despite the tempestuous history of
the first six months of their existence, was staring
the Morning Glories in the face. The club had
come to stay, and a prosperous and useful future
was assured. Prosperity meant that the treasury,
among other things, had become more than a
name, and the members of the club became possessed
with a desire to spend the money that had
been so laboriously earned, that was as burning
as had been the desire to get it.</p>

<p>"The gentlemen Morning Glories have just
got to be entertained," Mrs. Stout had declared
at a meeting held the week following Barbara's
wedding. "It ain't so much that we want to give
them a good time, we want to show the men-folks
that we can do somethin' without makin' a mess
of it, though I must own that some good has come
out of the trouble we've made already." There
was no opposition, in fact, the ladies were delighted
with the idea. Accordingly, plans for a reception
and dinner were quickly made and promptly
executed.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the function, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
weeks later, Mrs. Stout and Mrs. Blake stood in
the gorgeously decorated Veterans' Hall, admiring
the work of the committee, with the keenest satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Ain't it just elegant?" said Mrs. Stout.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," was Mrs. Blake's reply.</p>

<p>"Won't the men-folks be surprised?"</p>

<p>"They ought to be."</p>

<p>"I expect that my Peter won't say a word the
whole evenin' long&mdash;he ain't used to such things.
He tried to beg off, but I put my foot down and
said: 'No, sir; we've made plans to entertain you
men-folks, and you've just got to be entertained
whether you like it or not!'"</p>

<p>"And what did he say to that?" asked Mrs.
Blake, laughingly.</p>

<p>"'Give another show,' says he, 'if you want
to please the men.' Did you ever hear or know
of anything quite so queer as men? And say,
Mis' Blake, what do you s'pose? I got Peter to
go in town and get a real full dress suit."</p>

<p>"Really!" exclaimed Mrs. Blake, who could
not imagine Peter Stout dressed in anything except
a butcher's frock.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was just bound to have him dressed
up once 'fore he died, anyway. Goodness! if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
it ain't six o'clock. I must run home and help
Peter get into his clothes, and get dressed myself."</p>

<p>With that Mrs. Stout scurried home, while
Mrs. Blake lingered for one more look at the
tables and decorations.</p>

<p>Two hours later the officers of the club, who
formed the receiving party, were in their places.
They stood on a white sleigh-robe, loaned for the
occasion by undertaker Blake, and their background
was a Japanese screen, which, on every
other day in the year, could be found in the parlour
of Mrs. Jones. They were flanked on either side
by tabourets brought from the homes of Mrs.
Tweedie and Miss Sawyer, on which reposed
potted palms, the property of Mrs. Thornton, set
in jardini&egrave;res that Mrs. Darling's uncle, who was
a sea-captain, had brought her from India, and
that she "wouldn't have broken for worlds."</p>

<p>We common folk in common towns! What
good times we do have, but how much greater
would be our enjoyment did we not ape the
apes of wealth.</p>

<p>Mr. So-and-so is always uncomfortable in his
younger brother's dress suit. Mrs. What's-her-name
feels as though the glittering brooch at her
throat is on fire, because the gems are of paste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Mrs. Up-on-the-hill fears that some one will discover
that the beautiful opera cloak, which she
threw off so proudly, belongs to a friend in the
next town; and Mr. Ditto swears that never
again will he wear hired clothes, and adds several
postscripts.</p>

<p>Soon after eight o'clock, the receiving party
were overwhelmed with business, common folk
usually coming on time, despite their other faults,
and Manville society was no exception to the rule.
Some of the presentations were not as dignified
as many of the Morning Glories desired, Peter
Stout being one of the worst offenders. He began
by tripping over the white sleigh-robe, which confused
him so that he said everything that his wife
had told him not to say, and not a word of the
speech that she had informed him was the "perlite
and proper thing." When the series of mishaps
came to an end, he permitted the lady who had
presented him to lead him to a seat, where he sat
and glared into space, his face as red as raw beef,
until his wife came to pilot him through the
remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>Alick Purbeck said, "How d'y," and passed
on feeling well satisfied with himself. Deacon
Walton's "Cal'late we'll have an early spring,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the ladies cheerfully admitted. Sam Billings,
dressed as he had never been dressed before, said,
"Happy to meet yer," and then began a studied
speech, but was dragged away before he got
fairly started. Sam had been invited by Miss
Sawyer. The difficulties which had made their
wooing a thorn-strewn path had been cleared
away, and once more Sam seemed, with some
certainty of success, to be on the road to matrimony.
When some one recently had attempted to joke
him on the subject, he replied: "Seein' everybody's
made up their minds that me and Lizzie was
goin' to get married, we thought it would be too
bad to disappoint 'em." Ezra Tweedie, poor,
abused, dear little Ezra, was radiantly happy,
and during the whole evening conducted himself
in such a gentlemanly manner that, for the time
being, he was the pride and joy of his crownless
queen.</p>

<p>Then came the dinner. It was no Russian-tea-peanut-butter-frapp&eacute;-affair&mdash;there
were things
to eat. As the good cheer went in, the good-will
came out, reserve broke down, the murmur of
voices grew louder, followed by laughter, hearty
and spontaneous.</p>

<p>When the feasting was over, the toastmistress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Mrs. Tweedie, arose and graciously welcomed the
<i>other sex</i> without using her favourite term. Then
came the toasts, varied, many in number, and
followed by long responses. At midnight the
feast of good-will had not abated.</p>

<p>Barbara and Will, blissfully happy, wherever
they might be, had enjoyed the evening more
than any one else. From the beginning everybody
vied with everybody else in bestowing upon them
kind words and good wishes. They tried to slip
away before the others, but Mrs. Stout hurried
after them.</p>

<p>"What are you runnin' away for?" she demanded.
"Has anybody been sayin' things?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied Will, "not a word but
kindness."</p>

<p>"More than we deserve," added Barbara.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; more than you deserve, the idea!"
exclaimed Mrs. Stout, and then asked, wistfully,
"Well, can you forgive us now? We've done all
that we know how to do to make it right."</p>

<p>"Don't say 'we,' please, Mrs. Stout," said
Barbara. "As for the others, I forgave them
long&mdash;long ago."</p>

<p>"Bless you, dear child," replied Mrs. Stout,
and then she looked about as though in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of something. "Goodness!" she exclaimed,
"if I haven't lost Peter! Good night, if I don't
find him pretty soon he'll be talkin' butter and
eggs."</p>

<p>As Barbara and Will went out into the darkness,
the sweet, south wind blew in their faces, and
rustled the tiny leaves on the maples overhead.</p>

<p>"They were very kind to us to-night, Barbara,"
said Will. "But for you, dear, it has been a long,
hard journey." He felt her hand tighten on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Yes, Will, but the steepest paths lead to the
most beautiful places."</p>

<p>"And you do not regret one step of the cruel
way you have come?"</p>

<p>"Not one, Will."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you can say that, but I can't seem
to understand. What is the secret?"</p>

<p>"Faith, Will."</p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's God's way."</p>

<p>And thus they walked, and talked of God, and
love, and the future, until in the east the sky was
gleaming with gold.</p>

<p>A typical "Lilian Bell" book, bright, breezy, amusing, philosophic,
full of fun and bits of quotable humour.</p>

<p>Carolina is a fascinating American girl, born and educated in Paris,
and at the beginning of the story riding on the top wave of success
in New York society. A financial catastrophe leaves her stranded
without money, and her only material asset an old, run-down plantation
in South Carolina. In the face of strong opposition she goes
South to restore the old homestead and rebuild her fortunes. Complications
speedily follow, but, with indomitable faith and courage,
Carolina perseveres until her efforts are rewarded by success and
happiness.</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating games to childhood is the old-fashioned
"hide-and-seek," with its scurrying for covert, its breathless
suspense to both hider and seeker, and its wild dash for goal when
the seeker is successful. Readers of "The Motor Pirate" will remember
the exciting game played by the motor pirate and his pursuers,
and will be glad to have the sport taken up again in the new
volume.</p>

<p>In "The Cruise of the Motor-Boat Conqueror," a motor-boat
enables the motor pirate to pursue his victims in even a bolder and
more startling way, such, for example, as the hold-up of an ocean
steamer and the seizure for ransom of the Prince of Monte Carlo.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2ad1" id="Page_2ad1">[2]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>A bright, quickly moving detective story telling of the adventures
which befell a mysterious lady flying from Calais through France
into Italy, closely pursued by detectives. Her own quick wits,
aided by those of a gallant fellow passenger, give the two officers
an unlooked-for and exciting "run for their money." One hardly
realizes till now the dramatic possibilities of a railway train, and
what an opportunity for excitement may be afforded by a joint
railway station for two or more roads.</p>

<p>It is a well-planned, logical detective story of the better sort, free
from cheap sensationalism and improbability, developing surely and
steadily by means of exciting situations to an unforeseen and satisfactory
ending.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>The Voyage of the Arrow</div>

</div>

<p>Another of Captain Hains's inimitable sea stories, in which piracy,
storm, and shipwreck are cleverly intermingled with love and romance,
and vivid and picturesque descriptions of life at sea. Mr. Hains's
new story describes the capture on the high seas of an American
vessel by a gang of convicts, who have seized and burned the
English ship on which they were being transported, and their final
recapture by a British man-of-war.</p>

</div>

<p>This is a splendid story of adventure, full of good incidents that
are exceptionally exciting. The story deals with the search for gold
bullion, originally stolen from the Boer government in Pretoria, and
stored in a steamer sunk somewhere in the Mozambique Channel.
Two different search parties are endeavouring to secure the treasure,
and the story deals with their adventures and its final recovery by
one party only a few hours before the arrival of the second.</p>

<p>The book reads like an extract from life, and the whole story is
vivid and realistic with descriptions of the life of a party of gentlemen
adventurers who are willing to run great odds for great gains.</p>

<p>There is also "a woman in the case," Margaret Laurie, who proves
a delightful, reliant, and audacious heroine.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3ad1" id="Page_3ad1">[3]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>A double robbery and a murder have given Mr. Kauffman the
material for his clever detective story. Miss Baird tells how she
finally solved the mystery, and how she outwitted the other detective
at work on the case, by her woman's intuition and sympathy,
when her reputation for keenness and efficiency was hanging in the
balance.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>London Literary World</i> says: "In 'The Idlers' Mr. Morley
Roberts does for the smart set of London what Mrs. Wharton has
done in 'The House of Mirth' for the American social class of the
same name. His primary object seems to be realism, the portrayal
of life as it is without exaggeration, and we were impressed by the
reserve displayed by the novelist. It is a powerful novel, a merciless
dissection of modern society similar to that which a skilful surgeon
would make of a pathological case."</p>

<p>The <i>New York Sun</i> says: "<i>It is as absorbing as the devil.</i> Mr.
Roberts gives us the antithesis of 'Rachel Marr' in an equally
masterful and convincing work."</p>

<p><i>Professor Charles G. D. Roberts</i> says: "It is a work of great
ethical force."</p>

<p>Mr. Curtis is the poker expert of the <i>New York Sun</i>, and many
of the stories in "Stand Pat" originally appeared in the <i>Sun</i>. Although
in a sense short stories, they have a thread of continuity, in
that the principal characters appear throughout. Every poker player
will enjoy Mr. Curtis's clever recital of the strange luck to which
Dame Fortune sometimes treats her devotees in the uncertain game
of draw poker, and will appreciate the startling coups by which she
is occasionally outwitted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4ad1" id="Page_4ad1">[4]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>With the possible exception of Mr. Flandrau's work, the "Count
at Harvard" is the most natural and the most truthful exposition of
average student life yet written, and is thoroughly instinct with the
real college atmosphere. "The Count" is not a foreigner, but is
the nickname of one of the principal characters in the book.</p>

<p>The story is clean, bright, clever, and intensely amusing. Typical
Harvard institutions, such as the Hasty Pudding Club, <i>The Crimson</i>,
the Crew, etc., are painted with deft touches, which will fill the soul
of every graduate with joy, and be equally as fascinating to all college
students.</p>

<p>This is a story of the fisher and sailor folk of the Tantramar
marsh country about the head of the Bay of Fundy,&mdash;a region of
violent tides, of vast, fertile salt meadows fenced in from the tides
by interminable barriers of dyke,&mdash;and of a strenuous, adventurous
people who occupy themselves with all the romantic business of the
sea.</p>

<p>The passions of these people are vehement, like their tides, but
their natures have much of the depth, richness, and steadfastness
which characterize their exhaustless meadows.</p>

<p>The action turns upon the wisdom of the heart in discerning truth
and love where mere reason has seen but gross betrayal.</p>

<p>This powerful novel has for its theme "high finance" and the
"system." The Career of Richard Elliott, from office boy to Trust

brings a climax which foreshadows, perhaps, the fate of our own
